        <p>This is a highly practical and example-based guide on visually representing data in reports and dashboards.
            It is
            based on the work of authors such as Barbara Minto, Edward Tufte, and Stephen Few.</p>
        <p>The guide consists of seven chapters:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Convey a message.</li>
            <li>Organize content.</li>

    <h2 id="say--convey-a-message">SAY – Convey a message</h2>
    <p>SAY covers all aspects of conveying messages to the recipients of reports and presentations.</p>
    <p><em>Conveying messages</em> means that reports and presentations, both as a whole as well as within their
        individual components, intend to say something to the recipients. Messages in this sense can be determinations,
        explanations, clarifications, recommendations, and other forms of statements.</p>
    <p>This chapter covers introducing, delivering, supporting, and summarizing messages with respect to the objectives
        of senders and receivers.</p>

        <li><a href="#sa-5-summarize-message">Summarize message</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="sa-1-know-objectives">SA 1 Know objectives</h3>
    <p>Good reports (presentations) successfully achieve both the goals of the writer (speaker) and of the readers
        (audience).</p>
    <h3 id="sa-11-know-own-goals">SA 1.1 Know own goals</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-1.1.png" alt="Figure SA 1.1: Know own goals">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 1.1: Know own goals</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Do not start creating a report or presentation without a clear vision of what to achieve with it. The least goal
        is to inform about an interesting detection. A higher goal is to make the reader (audience) understand a problem
        by explaining it. The ultimate goal is to get a decision on a suggestion provided and to cause corresponding
        actions.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-12-know-target-audience">SA 1.2 Know target audience</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-1.2.png" alt="Figure SA 1.2: Know target audience">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 1.2: Know target audience</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A good report (presentation) will try to answer the questions of the readers (audience). So it is important to
        know the target audience (e.g. their function, position, network, knowledge, experience, attitude, behavior,
        worries, cultural background) and their goals, preferences, and expectations.  Do they only want to get informed
        about interesting detections, or are they looking for an explanation to a problem? Are they willing to make
        decisions and to act accordingly? Who might object to the message and why?</p>
    <h3 id="sa-2-introduce-message">SA 2 Introduce message</h3>
    <p>The addressees appreciate an introduction mapping the actual situation followed by an explanation of the given
        problem. Raising a question will focus on the given message.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-21-map-situation">SA 2.1 Map situation</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-2.1.png" alt="Figure SA 2.1: Map situation">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 2.1: Map situation</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Mapping the situation means compiling and presenting the related facts. Be sure to cover all relevant aspects and
        obtain a general consensus concerning the facts. In general, this means not yet describing the given problem but
        presenting facts and goals already known to the reader or audience. It is advisable to begin with a positive and
        generally accepted description of the situation in order to prevent early contradictions.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-22-explain-problem">SA 2.2 Explain problem</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-2.2.png" alt="Figure SA 2.2: Explain problem">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 2.2: Explain problem</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>After mapping the situation, introduce the challenge or complication, affecting the reader or the audience. It
        should make everyone aware of an interesting, critical, or even dangerous problem.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-23-raise-question">SA 2.3 Raise question</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-2.3.png" alt="Figure SA 2.3: Raise question">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 2.3: Raise question</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A good introduction raises the relevant question from the perspective of the recipient of how to solve the
        complication in the described situation. The question at the beginning of each report or presentation then leads
        to the message, i.e. the answer to the question.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-3-deliver-message">SA 3 Deliver message</h3>
    <p>Delivering the message means answering the question asked at the end of the introduction. Messages detect,
        explain, or suggest something the report or presentation later explains in detail.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-31-detect-explain-or-suggest">SA 3.1 Detect, explain, or suggest</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-3.1.png" alt="Figure SA 3.1: Detect, explain, or suggest">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 3.1: Detect, explain, or suggest</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Messages in reports and presentations can detect, evaluate, explain, warn, complain, threaten, excuse, suggest,
        or recommend something interesting. Make sure to deliver these messages in a complete sentence in order to be
        understood.</p>
    <p>Today, many messages in business reporting are pure <em>detections</em>. Since detections are statements that can
        be checked whether they are true or false, they should be formulated as precisely as possible.</p>
    <p>Explaining the reasons for a detection (<em>explanation</em>) or even deriving a <em>suggestion</em> on how to
        solve the problem or at least on how to further proceed can add value.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-3.1-1.png" alt="Figure SA 3.1.1: Classification of messages">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 3.1.1: Classification of messages</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This figure shows a classification of messages with examples from the business environment (Source: Hichert, R.
        and Kornwachs, K.)</p>
    <h3 id="sa-32-say-message-first">SA 3.2 Say message first</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-3.2.png" alt="Figure SA 3.2: Say message first">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 3.2: Say message first</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Every report, every presentation, and every single page or exhibit can be summed up with a clear overall message.
        This message usually comes first and is proven afterwards. For the readers or the audience it is more difficult
        to follow the storyline if the message comes at the end.</p>
    <p>Be cautious applying this rule in presentations (not in reports) with bad, unexpected, or unpleasant messages
        (e.g. layoffs) or in a cultural environment, where directness is considered impolite.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-4-support-message">SA 4 Support message</h3>
    <p><em>Supporting the message</em> covers some technical and practical aspects of message conveyance.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-41-provide-evidence">SA 4.1 Provide evidence</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-4.1.png" alt="Figure SA 4.1: Provide evidence">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 4.1: Provide evidence</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Substantiate the message in order to prove the message by facts and figures. If possible, a presentation slide
        should itself explain or prove the speaker’s message and not – as very often seen in practice – be explained by
        the speaker. This can be done by spoken sentences possibly supported by charts, tables, and pictures.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-42-use-precise-words">SA 4.2 Use precise words</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-4.2.png" alt="Figure SA 4.2: Use precise words">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 4.2: Use precise words</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The more unambiguous the language, the clearer the message. Only precise words will be understood. Speaking about
        “relevant” or “significant” (in common speech, not as a statistical term) content leads to misinterpretations
        and misunderstandings. Speaking about facts and figures will prevent them.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-43-highlight-message">SA 4.3 Highlight message</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-4.3.png" alt="Figure SA 4.3: Highlight message">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 4.3: Highlight message</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Visually highlight messages in the communication objects presented – namely in charts, tables, graphs, and
        pictures. This facilitates comprehension and reduces the time needed to understand complex situations. In most
        cases, it should be possible to highlight the important parts of the content by underlining the most important
        facts or emphasizing interesting details. Objects and pages without highlighting indicators tend to be a
        statistic rather than a report.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-44-name-sources">SA 4.4 Name sources</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-4.4.png" alt="Figure SA 4.4: Name sources">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 4.4: Name sources</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Naming sources for the material presented increases the credibility. Projected slides can omit them but written
        reports and handouts must include them.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-45-link-comments">SA 4.5 Link comments</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-4.5.png" alt="Figure SA 4.5: Link comments">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 4.5: Link comments</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Use comments in written reports and handouts to add explanations, conclusions, and similar statements. Projected
        slides in presentations rarely need any comments because the comments are given by the speaker.</p>
    <p>Number comments related to specific parts of a page (e.g. words, numbers, or visualization elements) and link
        them to the respective parts. Post numbered comments in text boxes on free areas of a page. General comments
        concerning the whole page are not numbered. Post them as a footnote at the bottom of a page.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-5-summarize-message">SA 5 Summarize message</h3>
    <p>Conclude a presentation with the overall message, including the next steps and an explanation of the
        consequences.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-51-repeat-message">SA 5.1 Repeat message</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-5.1.png" alt="Figure SA 5.1: Repeat message">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 5.1: Repeat message</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Avoid the phrase “Thank you for your attention” at the end of a presentation. Instead, presenters should briefly
        sum up their message one last time – in one sentence, if possible. At the conclusion of a successful
        presentation, the audience will be thanking the presenters for the information. Repeating the message from the
        beginning of a presentation at the end helps the audience check the quality of the storyline and brings the
        presentation full circle. In reports, on the other hand, such repetition is not necessary as the reader can
        quickly browse back to the respective summary at the beginning.</p>
    <h3 id="sa-52-explain-consequences">SA 5.2 Explain consequences</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/sa-5.2.png" alt="Figure SA 5.2: Explain consequences">
        <figcaption>Figure SA 5.2: Explain consequences</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Conclude reports and presentations with proposals for decisions to be taken and an explanation of their
        consequences. This is the real objective of a presentation: Convince the audience of both the message and the
        suggested steps to be taken next.</p>
    <h2 id="structure--organize-content">STRUCTURE – Organize content</h2>
    <p>STRUCTURE covers all aspects of organizing the content of reports and presentations.</p>
    <p><em>Organizing the content</em> means that reports and presentations follow a logical structure forming a
        convincing storyline.</p>
    <p>This chapter covers using consistent elements, building non-overlapping elements, building collectively
        exhaustive elements, building hierarchical structures, and visualizing their structure properly.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#st-1-use-consistent-elements">Use consistent elements</a></li>
        <li><a href="#st-2-build-non-overlapping-elements">Build non-overlapping elements</a></li>
        <li><a href="#st-3-build-collectively-exhaustive-elements">Build collectively exhaustive elements</a></li>
        <li><a href="#st-4-build-hierarchical-structures">Build hierarchical structures</a></li>
        <li><a href="#st-5-visualize-structure">Visualize structure</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="st-1-use-consistent-elements">ST 1 Use consistent elements</h3>
    <p>Listings and groupings of any kind of elements (items, terms, pictures, symbols, etc.) used to organize content
        in charts, tables, and texts should contain consistent elements only. This pertains for example to items,
        statements, wordings, and the appearance of symbols and pictures.</p>
    <h3 id="st-11-use-consistent-items">ST 1.1 Use consistent items</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-1.1.png" alt="Figure ST 1.1: Use consistent items">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 1.1: Use consistent items</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Items in a group should be of the same type, i.e. consistent. Consistent items can be different types of cars,
        houses, traffic signs, or – as shown in Figure ST 1.1, on the right hand side – different national flags
        representing the corresponding nations. The left hand side of this figure includes other types of items besides
        national flags, destroying the consistency.</p>
    <h3 id="st-12-use-consistent-types-of-statements">ST 1.2 Use consistent types of statements</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-1.2.png" alt="Figure ST 1.2: Use consistent types of statements">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 1.2: Use consistent types of statements</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A list of statements will be easier to understand if all statements are of the same type. The right hand side of
        Figure ST 1.2 shows four suggestions. By contrast, on the left-hand side of this figure the third statement is a
        detection, not a suggestion.</p>
    <h3 id="st-13-use-consistent-wording">ST 1.3 Use consistent wording</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-1.3.png" alt="Figure ST 1.3: Use consistent wording">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 1.3: Use consistent wording</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Structure all phrases – especially in listed arrangements – in a grammatically consistent manner to facilitate
        quicker understanding. The right hand side of Figure ST 1.3 shows a group of four consistent suggestions, an
        imperative verb paired with a noun. By contrast, on the left hand side of this figure the second suggestion uses
        verbal substantive instead of an imperative.</p>
    <h3 id="st-14-use-consistent-visualizations">ST 1.4 Use consistent visualizations</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-1.4.png" alt="Figure ST 1.4: Use consistent visualizations">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 1.4: Use consistent visualizations</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Visualizations such as symbols and pictures that are uniform in respect to their layouts, colors, forms, fonts,
        etc. – especially in listed arrangements – facilitate faster and easier comprehension.</p>
    <h3 id="st-2-build-non-overlapping-elements">ST 2 Build non-overlapping elements</h3>
    <p>Elements belonging to a group should not overlap, i.e. they should be disjoint or mutually exclusive. This
        concerns practical applications such as report structures, business measures, or structure dimensions.</p>
    <h3 id="st-21-build-non-overlapping-report-structures">ST 2.1 Build non-overlapping report structures</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-2.1.png" alt="Figure ST 2.1: Build non-overlapping report structures">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 2.1: Build non-overlapping report structures</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Structure reports and presentations in such a way that the parts, chapters, sections, and paragraphs do not
        overlap. They should not cover the same aspects.</p>
    <p>In Figure ST 2.1, on the left hand side, the following chapters of a project description overlap:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>expenses and costs</li>
        <li>schedule, steps, milestones, and calendar</li>
        <li>objective, results, and achievements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At first glance, the six terms on the right hand side of this figure have no overlap in their logical structure.
        Of course, a relationship exists between the <em>cost</em>, the <em>results</em>, and the <em>schedule</em> of a
        project, but in regards to the content of the chapters this is not an overlap.</p>
    <h3 id="st-22-build-non-overlapping-business-measures">ST 2.2 Build non-overlapping business measures</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-2.2.png" alt="Figure ST 2.2: Build non-overlapping business measures">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 2.2: Build non-overlapping business measures</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Structure a group of business measures in lists or calculations in a way they do not overlap, i.e. business
        measures on one hierarchical level should be disjoint or mutually exclusive.</p>
    <p>Looking at Figure ST 2.2, on the left hand side, the following business measures overlap</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>material costs</em> and <em>costs of goods sold</em></li>
        <li><em>depreciation</em> and <em>fixed costs</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The calculation scheme on the right hand side has been cleaned up.</p>
    <h3 id="st-23-build-non-overlapping-structure-dimensions">ST 2.3 Build non-overlapping structure dimensions</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-2.3.png" alt="Figure ST 2.3: Build non-overlapping structure dimensions">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 2.3: Build non-overlapping structure dimensions</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The elements of the <em>structure dimensions</em> used in reports and presentations should not overlap, i.e. the
        elements of a structure dimension should be disjoint or mutually exclusive.</p>
    <p>Looking at Figure ST 2.3 on the left hand side, the regions <em>Norway, Sweden, Denmark,</em> and
        <em>Finland</em>
        overlap with <em>Scandinavia</em>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="st-3-build-collectively-exhaustive-elements">ST 3 Build collectively exhaustive elements</h3>
    <p>A list of elements is considered to be exhaustive when they cover all aspects of a superordinate topic. For
        example, dividing <em>Europe</em> into <em>Germany</em>, <em>Austria</em>, <em>Switzerland</em>, and
        <em>Belgium</em>
        is not exhaustive because other countries also belong to Europe.
    </p>
    <p>Structures with mutually exclusive (ME) and collectively exhaustive (CE) elements are known as MECE structures.
    </p>
    <h3 id="st-31-build-exhaustive-arguments">ST 3.1 Build exhaustive arguments</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-3.1.png" alt="Figure ST 3.1: Build exhaustive arguments">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 3.1: Build exhaustive arguments</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If some important arguments relating to a specific question are left out, the given answer will not be
        convincing.</p>
    <p>Looking at Figure ST 3.1 on the left hand side the option “<em>old products, new location</em>” is missing.</p>
    <h3 id="st-32-build-exhaustive-structures-in-charts-and-tables">ST 3.2 Build exhaustive structures in charts and
        tables</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-3.2.png" alt="Figure ST 3.2: Build exhaustive structures in charts andtables">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 3.2: Build exhaustive structures in charts andtables</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The elements of structures presented in charts and tables should also be exhaustive, in other words, adding up to
        one hundred percent.</p>
    <p>In many practical applications of this kind, adding a remainder element (“rest of...”) helps to conform to this
        rule.</p>
    <h3 id="st-4-build-hierarchical-structures">ST 4 Build hierarchical structures</h3>
    <p>Give reports and presentations a hierarchical structure whenever possible, resulting in faster comprehension and
        simplified searching. These rules help to write and present a good storyline.</p>
    <h3 id="st-41-use-deductive-reasoning">ST 4.1 Use deductive reasoning</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-4.1.png" alt="Figure ST 4.1: Use deductive reasoning">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 4.1: Use deductive reasoning</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Exhibiting deductive reasoning (<em>logical flow</em>) for a given message aids in <em>building</em> hierarchical
        structures. <em>Logical flows</em> always answer the question “why” following the key message. They begin with a
        statement (all men are mortal), continue with a comment (Socrates is a man), and resolve with a conclusion
        (Socrates is mortal) culminating in the message (Socrates will die).</p>
    <p>Deductive reasoning can be best applied in controversial discussions for arguing and demonstrating need for
        action. However, it forces the readers or the audience to reproduce the deduction and the whole argumentation
        can collapse if any statements are questionable.</p>
    <h3 id="st-42-use-inductive-reasoning">ST 4.2 Use inductive reasoning</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-4.2.png" alt="Figure ST 4.2: Use inductive reasoning">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 4.2: Use inductive reasoning</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Exhibiting <em>inductive</em> reasoning (<em>logical group</em>) for a given message aids in understanding
        hierarchical structures. <em>Logical groups</em> are homogenous, non-overlapping, and collectively exhaustive
        arguments culminating in a message. This results in a powerful argumentation that satisfies the addressees need
        for an easily comprehensible logical structure.</p>
    <h3 id="st-5-visualize-structure">ST 5 Visualize structure</h3>
    <p>Having organized the arguments hierarchically, visualize this structure in order to make the storyline
        transparent.</p>
    <h3 id="st-51-visualize-structure-in-reports">ST 5.1 Visualize structure in reports</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/st-5.1.png" alt="Figure ST 5.1: Visualize structure in reports">
        <figcaption>Figure ST 5.1: Visualize structure in reports</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For easier understanding, underscore the logical structure of reports and presentations with visual aids (e.g.
        outlines, dashboards, summaries). Figure ST 5.1 illustrates this rule showing binder tabs on the right hand
        side.</p>
    <h3 id="st-52-visualize-structure-in-tables">ST 5.2 Visualize structure in tables</h3>

    <h3 id="ex-1-use-appropriate-object-types">EX 1 Use appropriate object types</h3>
    <p>Choosing the appropriate <em>object type</em> is of prime importance for the comprehension of reports and
        presentations.</p>
    <p>We use tables when looking up data. Tables have a high information density. They are clear, they are honest, they
        do not want to highlight, and they typically do not want to visually convey a certain message. So they do not
        compete with charts.</p>
    <p>Charts on the opposite are always biased. It is the selection of data, the selection of the chart type, and the
        usage of highlighting which makes the difference. We evaluate charts by asking whether they transfer the
        intended message effectively and in a proper way. So charts cannot be replaced by tables.</p>
    <p>The following section is about choosing the appropriate types of charts and tables. It presents in detail
        different types, layouts, and examples as well as their proper application.</p>

    <p>A <em>chart</em> is a graphical object, in which visualization elements such as columns, bars, and lines
        represent
        data.</p>
    <p>This section discusses the types, layout, and examples of <em>single charts</em>. <em>Overlay charts</em><em>and
            multiple charts</em> are discussed in the CO 4 “<a href="#co-4-add-elements">Add elements</a>” and CO 5 “<a
            href="#co-5-add-objects">Add objects</a>”.</p>
    <p>The most important groups of business charts are those showing development over time (charts with horizontal
        category axes), those showing structural relationships (charts with vertical category axes), and those showing
        x‑y charts, scatter plots, and bubble charts (charts with two value axes), see Figure EX 1.1.</p>
    <p>Other chart types are of lesser interest in business communication and will be treated in a later version of the
        standards.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-1.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-1: Chart Types">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-1: Chart Types</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Looking at charts with horizontal and vertical category axes, the chart selection matrix displayed in the figure
        aids in selecting the right chart type for time series and structure analyses.</p>
    <p>In the following sections, the correct usage of <em>charts with horizontal category axes</em>, <em>charts with
            vertical category axes</em>, and <em>charts with two value axes</em> is discussed in greater detail.</p>
    <p><strong>Charts with horizontal category axes</strong></p>
    <p>Charts with horizontal category axes (short:<em>horizontal charts</em>) typically display time series. Use the
        horizontal category axis as a time axis. Vertically, the visualization elements represent the data per time
        period or point of time (there is no need to show a vertical value axis as the visualization elements carry
        their own values). Time category axes run from left to right and show characteristics of period types (e.g.
        months or years) or points of time (dates).</p>
    <p>In general, the data series of a <em>horizontal chart</em> is represented by columns (single, stacked, grouped),
        vertical pins, horizontal waterfalls, or lines. <em>Vertical pins</em> can be considered very thin columns.
        Because of their importance, they are dealt with in a separate section.</p>
    <p>Here follows the grouping of <em>horizontal chart types</em>:</p>
    <p><strong>Single column charts</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-2.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-2: Single column charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-2: Single column charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In general, <em>single column charts</em> (short: single columns) are used to display the temporal evolvement of
        one data series.</p>
    <p>Single columns consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Horizontal category axis:</strong> The <em>horizontal category axis</em> represents with its
                labels the respective time periods or points of time. The part on “Semantic rules” suggests to use the
                category width (see width A in the figure) for identifying the period type (see UN 3.3 “<a
                    href="#un-33-unify-time-periods-and-points-of-time">Unify time periods</a>”).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Columns</strong>: One <em>column</em> per time period or point of time extends from the category
                axis in accordance with the respective value. Columns are displayed in the foreground of the category
                axis, so that the length of the column is not hidden. The part on “Semantic rules” suggests that the
                ratio of column width to category width (see ratio B/A in the figure) represents information about the
                measure type (see UN 3.1 “<a href="#un-31-unify-measures">Unify measures</a>”).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Legends</strong>: As there is only one data series, the legend (name of the data series) is part
                of the chart title.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Data labels</strong>:<em>Data labels</em> name the values of the data series corresponding to the
                length of the respective columns. Position the labels of positive values above their respective columns,
                the labels of negative values below.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Stacked column charts</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-3.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-3: Stacked column charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-3: Stacked column charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Stacked column charts</em> (short: stacked columns) represent more than one data series (e.g. multiple
        products, countries, or divisions), see the figure on the left.</p>
    <p>Stacked columns consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Horizontal category axis:</strong> See single column charts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Columns</strong>: The columns (see single column charts) are divided into segments (Excel names
                them “data points”) representing the data series (stacked columns).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Legends</strong>: Legends (names of the data series) are positioned either on the far left side
                with right-aligned text or on the far right side with left-aligned text. The column segments define
                their vertical position, centered vertically with the data labels of the respective column segment. If a
                segment at the far left or far right is missing or has a very small size, its legends might need
                assisting lines.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Data labels</strong>:<em>Data labels</em> name the values of the data series corresponding to the
                length of the respective column segments. If the sum of the column segments of a category is positive
                (column pointing upward), the label of the sum is positioned above the respective column, if negative
                (column pointing downward), it is positioned below.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It must be pointed out that stacked columns should only be used if all chart values are either positive or
        negative.</p>
    <p>This chart type might also not be a good choice if the values of each data series vary too much. The maximum
        number of data series (segments of a stacked column) to be shown depends on the range of how much the values of
        each data series vary: More than 5 data series will only work well in the case of little variations.</p>
    <p>Position the data series of central importance or interest directly on the axis in order to best see its
        development over time.</p>
    <p><strong>Grouped column charts</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-4.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-4: Grouped column charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-4: Grouped column charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Grouped column charts</em> (short: grouped columns) show, in general, time series for a primary scenario
        (e.g. AC or FC) in comparison with a reference scenario (e.g. PY or PL). Two columns per category (<em>grouped
            columns</em>) represent these two scenarios.</p>
    <p>The columns of the primary scenario and the reference scenario overlap, the reference scenario placed behind the
        primary scenario – either to the left or right of the primary scenario (see bottom chart of the figure as well
        as the paragraph on ”Scenario comparisons” in UN 4.1 “<a href="#un-41-unify-scenario-analyses">Unify scenario
            analyses</a>”). A third scenario could be displayed using a <em>reference scenario triangle</em>. All other
        elements of a grouped column chart are identical to single column charts.</p>
    <p>Instead of using grouped columns, the primary scenario can be represented with a single column with the reference
        scenario represented by reference scenario triangles (see top chart of the figure).</p>
    <p><strong>Horizontal pin charts</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-5.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-5: Horizontal pin charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-5: Horizontal pin charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Horizontal pin charts</em> (short: horizontal pins) are used for the visualization of relative variances in a
        time series analysis.</p>
    <p>Horizontal pins consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Horizontal category axis:</strong> see <em>single column chart</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Pins</strong>: One <em>pin</em> per time period or point of time extends from the category axis
                to
                the respective length. The pin has the size of a very thin column. Color the pin green or red
                corresponding with positive or negative relative variances respectively. The fill of the pinhead
                represents the primary scenario (see the paragraph on “Scenario comparisons” in UN 4.1 “<a
                    href="#un-41-unify-scenario-analyses">Unify scenario analyses</a>”). Display the pin in the
                foreground, so that the length of the pin (see length X in the figure) is not hidden.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Legends</strong>: As there is only one data series, the legend (name of the data series) is part
                of the chart title.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Data labels</strong>:<em>Data labels</em> name the values of the data series consistent with the
                length of the respective pins. Position the labels of positive values above the respective pins, labels
                of negative values below.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Horizontal waterfall charts</strong></p>
    <p><em>Horizontal waterfall charts</em> (short:<em>horizontal waterfalls</em> or <em>column waterfalls</em>) analyze
        root causes, over time, for the change or variance between two or more statuses. Accordingly, horizontal
        waterfalls consist of two or more <em>base columns and totals columns</em>. In between a base column and a
        totals
        column there are <em>contribution columns</em> demonstrating what led to the difference between these two
        columns. The <em>contribution columns</em> start at the end value, i.e. the height, of the preceding column, and
        show the positive or negative contribution as well as the accumulated contribution of all columns up to the
        respective point of time.</p>
    <p>There are two types of horizontal waterfalls:</p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-6.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-6: Growth waterfalls">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-6: Growth waterfalls</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>Growth waterfalls</strong>: In <em>growth waterfalls</em>, base columns and totals columns represent a
        stock measure (e.g. headcount, accounts receivable) at different points in time (e.g. end of Q4 2012, 2013 and
        2014). The contribution columns in between represent the changes (increases and decreases) over time of this
        stock measure.</p>
    <p>(There is no vertical equivalent to the horizontal <em>growth waterfall</em>.)</p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-7.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-7: Horizontal variance waterfalls">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-7: Horizontal variance waterfalls</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>Horizontal variance waterfalls</strong>: In <em>horizontal variance waterfalls</em>, base columns and
        totals columns represent a flow measure (e.g. sales) at different periods in time (e.g. 2015 and 2016) and/or
        regarding different scenarios (e.g. PL and AC). The contribution columns in between represent the periodical
        variances between the different time periods and/or scenarios.</p>
    <p>The elements of a horizontal waterfall chart are the same as the elements of single column charts. In
        addition, <em>assisting lines</em> connect the end of a column to the beginning of the succeeding column.</p>
    <p><strong>Line charts</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-8.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-8: Line chart">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-8: Line chart</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In general, <em>line charts</em> are used for the display of the temporal evolvement of data series with many
        data
        points.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-9.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-9: Line chart with selective data labels">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-9: Line chart with selective data labels</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Many data points lead to small category widths. The advantage of line charts over column charts is the simplified
        display of data (better <em>data-ink-ratio</em>). In addition, they can better represent positive and negative
        values of more than one data series than columns. On the other hand, lines tend to imply a continuous timeline –
        practically non-existent in business communication. Therefore lines should not be used for the presentation of
        data series with only a few values.</p>
    <p>Line charts cannot be “stacked” in order to show structure like in stacked column charts. In the place of line
        charts for “stacked data”, <em>area charts</em> offer a good solution (there is no layout concept for area
        charts
        in this version of the guide yet).</p>
    <p>Line charts with more than three intersecting lines tend to be confusing. Instead, several smaller charts with
        one line each could be placed next to one another (small multiples), particularly when the general trends of the
        lines are to be analyzed – not the direct comparison of two data series (e.g. in comparing seasonal developments
        of several years), see also EX 2.4 “<a href="#ex-24-replace-spaghetti-charts">Replace spaghetti charts</a>”.</p>
    <p>Line charts consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Horizontal category axis:</strong> See <em>single column chart</em>. The semantic rules in part 3
                suggest to use the category width (see width A in the first figure) for identifying the period type (see
                UN 3.3 “<a href="#un-33-unify-time-periods-and-points-of-time">Unify time periods</a>”).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Lines</strong>: One or more <em>lines</em> with <em>line markers</em> represent the values of the
                respective data series. Use line thickness, line color, and line markers for meaning, see part “Semantic
                rules”.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Legends</strong>:<em>Legends</em> label the data series. If the line chart shows only one data
                series, include the legend in the chart title. If the line chart shows two or more data series, the
                legend should be positioned to the right of the far right data point (left-aligned text, see first
                figure) or the left of the far left data point (right-aligned text, see second figure). Alternatively
                position legends close to the lines at any other place in the chart.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Data labels</strong>:<em>Data labels</em> name the values of the respective data points. If
                possible, label maximum values (peaks) above the line markers and minimum values (valleys) below the
                line markers. In many practical applications it is not necessary to clutter the line chart by labeling
                every data point, see second figure on the left and SI 5.3 “<a
                    href="#si-53-avoid-unnecessary-labels">Avoid unnecessary labels</a>”.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Other horizontal charts</strong></p>
    <p>Other chart types with horizontal category axes are <em>boxplot charts</em> (range charts) and <em>area
            charts</em>. There is no specific notation concept for these chart types yet however it can be easily
        derived from the notation concept of column and line charts.</p>
    <p><strong>Charts with vertical category axes</strong></p>
    <p>Charts with vertical category axes (<em>vertical charts</em>) typically show structural data. In general, present
        structural data of one period or one point of time in the form of <em>bars</em>.</p>
    <p>Use the vertical category as a structure axis. Horizontally, the visualization elements represent the data per
        structure element (there is no need for a horizontal value axis as the visualization elements carry their own
        values). Structure axes run from top to bottom and show characteristics of structures (e.g. products or
        countries). The sequence of these elements depends on the intended analysis; see the UNIFY section about
        “Structure analyses”.</p>
    <p>In general, the data series of a vertical chart is represented by (horizontal)<em>bars</em> (single, stacked,
        grouped), by <em>horizontal pins</em>, or by <em>waterfall bars</em>. Do not use lines in vertical charts as
        they
        could be interpreted as trends or developments, which do not exist in structure analyses.</p>
    <p><em>Horizontal pins</em> can be considered very thin bars, but because of their importance are dealt with in a
        separate section. A chart with horizontal pins is called a <em>vertical pin chart</em>.</p>
    <p>Here follows the grouping of <em>vertical chart types</em>:</p>
    <p><strong>Single bar charts</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-10.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-10: Single bar charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-10: Single bar charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In general, <em>single bar charts</em> (short: single bars) are used for the structural analysis of one data
        series (e.g., products, countries, or divisions) for one period or one point in time.</p>
    <p>Single bar charts consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Vertical category axis:</strong> The <em>vertical category axis</em> with its labels represents
                the respective structure elements such as countries, products, etc. The category width (see width A in
                figure) should be the same for corresponding analyses.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Bars</strong>: One <em>bar</em> per structure element extends from the category axis to the
                length
                representing the respective value. Display the bars in the foreground of the category axis, so that the
                length of the bar is not hidden. The part on “Semantic rules” suggests that the ratio of bar width to
                category width (see ratio B/A in figure) represents information about the measure type (see UN 3.1 “<a
                    href="#un-31-unify-measures">Unify measures</a>”).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Legends</strong>: As there is only one data series, the legend (name of the data series) is part
                of the chart title.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Data labels</strong>:<em>Data labels</em> name the values of the data series consistent with the
                length of the respective bars. Position the labels of positive values at the right hand side of the
                respective bars, the labels of negative values at the left hand side.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Stacked bar charts</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-11.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-11: Stacked bar charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-11: Stacked bar charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Stacked bar charts (short: stacked bars) represent more than one data series (e.g., products, countries, or
        divisions) for one period or one point in time.</p>
    <p>Stacked bar charts consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Vertical category axis: See single bar charts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Bars</strong>: The bars (see single bar charts) are divided into segments (Excel names them“data

        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Legends</strong>: Legends (names of the data series) are positioned either above the top stacked
                bar or below the bottom stacked bar, with the bar segments defining their horizontal position: they are
                horizontally centered with the data labels of the respective bar segment. If a segment at the top or
                bottom is missing or has a very small size, its legend might need assisting lines.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Data labels</strong>:<em>Data labels</em> name the values of the data series corresponding to the
                length of the respective bar segment. If the sum of the bar segments of a category is positive (bar
                pointing to the right), the label of the sum is positioned to the right hand side of the respective bar.
                If the sum is negative (bar pointing to the left), the label of the sum is positioned to the left hand
                side of the respective bar.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It must be pointed out that stacked bars should only be used if all chart values are either positive or negative.
    </p>
    <p>This chart type might also not be a good choice if the values of each data series vary too much. The maximum
        number of data series (segments of a stacked bars) to be shown depends on the range of how much the values of
        each data series vary: More than 5 data series will only work well in the case of little variations.</p>
    <p>Position the data series of central interest directly at the axis in order to best see its structure.</p>
    <p><strong>Grouped bar charts</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-12.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-12: Grouped bar charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-12: Grouped bar charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In general, <em>grouped bar charts</em> (short: grouped bars) show structure analyses for a primary scenario
        (e.g.
        AC or FC) in comparison to a reference scenario (e.g. PY or PL). Two bars per category (<em>grouped bars)</em>
        represent <em>these</em> two scenarios.</p>
    <p>The bars of the primary scenario and the reference scenario overlap, the reference scenario placed behind the
        primary scenario – either above or below (see the bottom chart of the figure as well as the paragraph on
        “Scenario comparisons” in UN 4.1 “<a href="#un-41-unify-scenario-analyses">Unify scenario analyses</a>”).</p>
    <p>A third scenario could be displayed using a <em>reference scenario triangle</em>. All other elements of a grouped
        bar chart are identical to a single bar chart.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, instead of grouped bars, the primary scenario can be represented with a single bar and the
        reference scenario by reference scenario triangles (see top chart of figure).</p>
    <p><strong>Vertical pin charts</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-13.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-13: Vertical pin charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-13: Vertical pin charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Vertical pin charts</em> (short: vertical pins) are used for the visualization of relative variances in a
        structure analysis.</p>
    <p>Vertical pins consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Vertical category axis: see <em>single bar chart</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Pins</strong>: One <em>pin</em> per structure element extends from the category axis to the
                respective length. The pin has the size of a very thin bar. It is colored green or red when representing
                positive or negative relative variances respectively. The fill of the pinhead represents the primary
                scenario (see the paragraph on “Scenario comparisons” in UN 4.1 “<a
                    href="#un-41-unify-scenario-analyses">Unify scenario analyses</a>”). Display pins in the foreground,
                so that the length of the pin (see length X in the figure) is not hidden.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Legends</strong>: As there is only one data series, the legend (name of the data series) is part
                of the chart title.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Data labels</strong>:<em>Data labels</em> name the values of the data series corresponding to the length
        of the respective pins. Position the labels of positive values at the right hand side of the respective pins,
        the labels of negative values at the left hand side.</p>
    <p><strong>Vertical waterfall charts</strong></p>
    <p><em>Vertical waterfalls charts</em> (in short:<em>vertical waterfalls</em> or <em>bar waterfalls</em>) analyze
        structural root causes for the difference between two or more statuses. Accordingly, vertical waterfalls consist
        of two or more <em>base bars</em> and <em>totals bars</em>. In between a base bar and a totals bar there
        are <em>contribution bars</em> representing the contribution to the difference between these two bars. Starting
        from the top base bar, <em>contribution bars</em> always start at the end of the preceding bar, showing positive
        or negative individual contributions of the respective structure element as well as the accumulated contribution
        resulting in the next totals bar.</p>
    <p>There are two types of vertical waterfalls:</p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-14.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-14: Calculation waterfalls">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-14: Calculation waterfalls</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>Calculation waterfalls</strong>: In <em>calculation waterfalls</em>, base bars and totals bars represent
        base and result measures (e.g. sales and EBIT) whereas the contribution bars in between represent the additions
        and subtractions of other measures (e.g. financial income and direct cost) in a calculation scheme. More complex
        calculation schemes (e.g. profit and loss calculation) can have intermediate subtotals bars.</p>
    <p>(There is no horizontal correspondence to the vertical <em>calculation waterfall</em>.)</p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-15.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-15: Vertical variance waterfalls">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-15: Vertical variance waterfalls</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>Vertical variance waterfalls</strong>: In <em>vertical variance waterfalls</em>, base bars and totals
        bars
        represent values at different periods or points in time (e.g. January 1, 2013 and January 1, 2014) and/or
        different scenarios (e.g. PY and AC). The contribution bars in between represent the variances in structure
        between the different times and/or scenarios.</p>
    <p>The elements of vertical waterfalls are the same as the elements of single bar charts. In addition, <em>assisting
            lines</em> connect the end of a bar with the beginning of the succeeding bar.</p>
    <p><strong>Remainder bar</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-16.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-16: Remainder bar">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-16: Remainder bar</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If a large number of elements need to be presented, then only the most important elements can be displayed in one
        chart or on one page. In order to make the analyses exhaustive, sort the elements by descending size,
        accumulating the smallest elements, which cannot be depicted, in a <em>remainder bar</em> (“rest of...”).
        Separate the remainder bar from the other bars by a wider gap (see gap C in the figure on the left).</p>
    <p>Note: This remainder bar has to be excluded from some Structure analyses such as averaging, ranking, and
        selecting.</p>
    <p><strong>Other vertical charts</strong></p>
    <p>Other chart types with vertical category axes are <em>vertical boxplot charts</em> (range charts). There is no
        specific notation concept for this chart type yet however it can be derived from the notation of the standard
        bar charts.</p>
    <p>In general, do not use lines and areas in vertical charts as they might underline a continuum of data
        non-existent in business communication.</p>
    <p><strong>Charts with two values axes</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-17.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-17: Charts with two values axes">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-17: Charts with two values axes</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Charts with two value axes</em> show two-dimensional positioning of visualization elements, which can provide
        new and interesting insights. <em>Scattergrams</em> arrange points in a two-dimensional coordinate system.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.1-18.png" alt="Figure EX 1.1-18: Bubble charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.1-18: Bubble charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Bubble charts</em> (portfolio charts) have bubbles instead of points and use the bubble area to show a third
        dimension. A fourth dimension could be presented via pie segments within the bubbles (bubble pie charts).</p>
    <p>Besides <em>scattergrams</em> and <em>bubble charts</em> there are other chart types with two value axes, e.g.
        charts with horizontal axes representing a continuous timeline (instead of fixed time categories) and charts
        with columns or bars of variable width.</p>
    <p>There are no specific notation rules for charts with two value axes yet. An appropriate notation concept for
        these chart types can be derived from the notation of column charts, bar charts and line charts with their data
        visualization elements, legends, data labels, and axes.</p>
    <h3 id="ex-12-use-appropriate-table-types">EX 1.2 Use appropriate table types</h3>
    <p>A <em>table</em> is a communication object in which data is arranged in two dimensions, i.e.
        (vertical)<em>columns
            and</em> (horizontal)<em>rows</em>. The <em>row header</em> (row name) describes the content of a row,
        the <em>column header</em> (column name) the content of a column. The data are positioned at the intersections
        of
        rows and columns called <em>table cells</em>.</p>
    <p>“One-dimensional tables” (tables with one or more columns but without row headers) are called <em>lists</em> and
        are not covered here.</p>
    <p><em>Table types</em> are defined by a set of <em>columns</em> and a set of <em>rows</em> in order to fulfill
        specific analytic and/or reporting purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Column types</strong></p>
    <p>Column types are columns with similar content falling under similar column headers. Typical column types
        are <em>time columns</em> (with monthly or yearly data), <em>scenario columns</em> (with actual or plan data)
        and <em>variance columns</em> (ΔPL or ΔPY).</p>
    <p>The following layout principles apply to all column types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Width</strong>: Columns belonging to a certain column type should have an identical width. This
                column width should not depend on the text length of the respective column header.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Orientation</strong>: Right-align columns with numerical data. Left-align columns with
                non-numerical data (e.g. texts or product names). <em>Column headers</em> have the same orientation as
                the rest of the column. Headers for combined columns can be centered or even left-aligned to increase
                legibility.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Vertical lines and gaps</strong>: Vertical lines separating different columns should be very
                light or even omitted. Use white vertical lines or white vertical gaps to mark the columns. In the
                following figures, different widths of these white lines resp. gaps are being used to separate and group
                columns. Separate columns of the same type by a narrow gap (see gap B1 in the figure in section
                “Scenario columns” et seq.). Use a wider gap to separate a group of similar columns from the next group
                (see gap B2 in the figure in section “Row header columns” et seq.).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional layout principals depend on the <em>column types</em> described below.</p>
    <p><strong>Row header columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-1.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-1: Row header columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-1: Row header columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Row header columns contain the header texts of the rows. Often, these columns are positioned at the very left of
        a table. In most cases, row header columns are much wider than other column types.</p>
    <p>Keep the texts of the row headers short by using abbreviations or footnotes in order to omit too wide tables.</p>
    <p>Use a wider gap (see width B2 in the figure) to separate the <em>row header column</em> from columns with
        numbers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Scenario columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-2.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-2: Scenario columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-2: Scenario columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Scenario columns</em> show data for scenarios (e.g. previous year, plan, actual). Use the same width for all
        scenario columns (depending on the number of digits).</p>
    <p>For the sequence of scenario columns see UN 4.1 “<a href="#un-41-unify-scenario-analyses">Unify scenario
            ana­lyses</a>”.</p>
    <p><strong>Variance columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-3.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-3: Variance columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-3: Variance columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Variance columns</em> show data of absolute variances (e.g. ΔPL, ΔPY) or relative variances (e.g. ΔPL%,
        ΔPY%).</p>
    <p><strong>Time columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-4.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-4: Time columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-4: Time columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Time columns</em> show <em>time periods</em> (for flow measures) or <em>points of time</em> (for stock
        measures).</p>
    <p>Use a temporal order – from left to right – for the sequence of the time columns (e.g. Jan, Feb, Mar, or 2013,
        2014, 2015).</p>
    <p><strong>Measure columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-5.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-5: Measure columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-5: Measure columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Measure columns</em> show measures such as sales, headcount, or equity.</p>
    <p>Displaying long measure names in column headers can be challenging. As the column width should not depend on the
        length of the measure name, use the abbreviations defined in the glossary instead.</p>
    <p>Use a wider gap after intermediate results to expose the calculation scheme (see width B2 in the figure on the
        left).</p>
    <p><strong>Structure columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-6.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-6: Structure columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-6: Structure columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Structure columns</em> show the elements of a structure dimension (e.g. countries or products).</p>
    <p><strong>“Thereof” columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-7.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-7: “Thereof” columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-7: “Thereof” columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If details of an aggregated column are shown in one or more column not totaling to the aggregated column, these
        columns are called “thereof” columns.</p>
    <p>The design of the <em>thereof columns</em> should differ from other columns. E.g. use a smaller font (see X in
        the
        figure) to expose a <em>thereof column</em> and do not separate it from the mother column (see
        columns <em>AL3</em> and <em>AL3.1</em> in the figure) in order to show that it is part of it. A <em>thereof
            column</em> is positioned at the right hand side of the mother column.</p>
    <p><strong>Remainder columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-8.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-8: Remainder columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-8: Remainder columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If the set to be presented in the columns has too many elements, accumulate the less important or smaller
        elements in a <em>remainder column</em> (e.g. 10 columns for the top 10 countries and a remainder column
        titled“Rest of world” or “RoW”).</p>
    <p>In the figure, the <em>remainder column</em> “Other cost” has the same vertical gaps B1 as the other measure
        columns.</p>
    <p><strong>“Percent of” columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-9.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-9: “Percent of” columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-9: “Percent of” columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Use “<em>Percent of</em>” columns to present important data of another column as shares of a given total. A
        typical example for a “percent of” column is data of a profit and loss statement as a percentage of sales.</p>
    <p>“Percent of” columns have a smaller font size (see X) than the other columns.</p>
    <p><strong>Totals columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-10.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-10: Totals columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-10: Totals columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Position columns displaying <em>totals of a group of columns</em> (e.g. quarters totaling in years or products
        totaling in product groups) at the right hand side of the columns belonging to this group. The design of
        the <em>totals columns</em> should differ from other columns, e.g. highlighted by bold fonts or by light gray
        background.</p>
    <p>The column types described before refer to <em>single</em> columns. The following paragraphs
        present <em>combined</em> columns i.e. <em>hierarchical</em> and <em>nested</em> columns.</p>
    <p><strong>Hierarchical columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-11.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-11: Hierarchical columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-11: Hierarchical columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Hierarchies in dimensions may call for columns showing multiple levels. If possible, the sibling elements
        belonging to the same parent element of a dimension should be homogenous, mutually exclusive, and collectively
        exhaustive.</p>
    <p>Separate parents by appropriate means, e.g. wider gaps. Display the parent columns at the right hand side of
        their child columns (like <em>totals columns</em>).</p>
    <p>In the figure, a wider gap B2 separates the two years (with four quarters each) from each other.</p>
    <p><strong>Nested columns</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-12.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-12: Nested columns">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-12: Nested columns</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In <em>nested columns</em>, two column types are combined in such a way that the columns of one type repeat
        iteratively within every column of the other type. Separate the resulting groups of columns by appropriate
        means, e.g. wider gaps.</p>
    <p>In the figure, wider gaps B2 separate the four years (with AC and PL data each) from each other.</p>
    <p><strong>Row types</strong></p>
    <p><em>Row types</em> are rows with similar content falling under similar row headers. Typical row types
        are <em>measure rows</em> (e.g. sales, cost, profit) or <em>structure rows</em> (e.g. Italy, France, UK).</p>
    <p>The following layout principles apply to all row types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Height</strong>: Rows belonging to a row type should have an identical height (see height A in
                the figure in section “measure rows” et seq.).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Horizontal lines</strong>: Separating rows by light horizontal lines will increase the
                legibility.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional layout principals depend on the row types described below.</p>
    <p><em>Time periods and points of time</em>, <em>scenarios</em>, and <em>variances</em> should be displayed in
        columns
        rather than in rows.</p>
    <p><strong>Column header rows</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-13.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-13: Column header rows">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-13: Column header rows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Column header rows contain the header texts of the columns. In most cases, these rows are positioned at the very
        top of a table. In order to group columns two and more column header rows might be necessary. If necessary,
        abbreviate column header texts in order to fit in the preferred column width. Alternatively keep column headers
        short by using footnotes.</p>
    <p>In the figure the <em>column header row</em> uses two lines in order to fit the column header texts in the narrow
        columns.</p>
    <p><strong>Measure rows</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-14.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-14: Measure rows">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-14: Measure rows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Measure rows</em> show measures such as sales, headcount, or equity.</p>
    <p>Separate rows showing final or intermediate results of a calculation scheme (<em>results rows</em><em>or totals
            rows</em>) by solid lines. Display results rows in bold font or highlight them with light gray background.
        An additional gap B below a results row will increase legibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure rows</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-15.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-15: Structure rows">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-15: Structure rows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Structure rows show elements of a structure dimension (e.g. countries or products).</p>
    <p><strong>“Thereof” rows</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-16.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-16: “Thereof” rows">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-16: “Thereof” rows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If details of an aggregated row are shown in one or more rows not totaling to the aggregated row, these rows are
        called “thereof” rows. Place the aggregated <em>above</em> the “thereof” rows (in contrast to the <em>totals
            row</em> positioned <em>below</em> the rows of its group).</p>
    <p>The design of the <em>thereof rows</em> should differ from other rows. E.g. in the figure, the <em>thereof
            row</em>
        is of smaller height, written in a smaller font (see X), not separated by a horizontal line, and has a
        right-aligned row header.</p>
    <p><strong>Remainder rows</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-17.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-17: Remainder rows">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-17: Remainder rows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If the structure dimension to be presented in the rows outline has too many elements, accumulate the less
        important or smaller elements in a <em>remainder row</em> (e.g. 7 rows for the top 7 countries and a remainder
        titled “Rest of world”).</p>
    <p>Exclude remainder rows from some of the Structure analyses such as averaging, ranking, and selecting.</p>
    <p>In the figure, the <em>remainder row</em> has the same row height A as the other structure rows of this table
        example.</p>
    <p><strong>“Percent of” rows</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-18.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-18: “Percent of” rows">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-18: “Percent of” rows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Use “<em>Percent of</em>” rows to present important data of another row as shares of a given total. A typical
        example for a “<em>percent of</em>” row is gross profit as a percentage of sales.</p>
    <p>“Percent of” rows have a smaller font size (see X) than the other rows.</p>
    <p><strong>Totals rows</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-19.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-19: Totals rows">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-19: Totals rows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Place rows displaying <em>totals of a group of rows</em> (e.g. countries totaling in regions or products totaling
        in product groups) below the rows of this group and separated them by solid lines.</p>
    <p>The design of the <em>totals rows</em> should differ from other rows, e.g. highlighted by bold fonts or by light
        gray background.</p>
    <p>The row types described before refer to <em>single</em> rows. The following paragraphs present <em>combined</em>
        rows i.e. <em>hierarchical</em> and <em>nested</em> rows.</p>
    <p><strong>Hierarchical rows</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-20.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-20: Hierarchical rows">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-20: Hierarchical rows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Hierarchies in dimensions may call for rows showing multiple levels. If possible, the sibling elements belonging
        to the same parent element of a dimension should be homogenous, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive.
    </p>
    <p>Separate parents by appropriate means, e.g. wider gaps (see additional gap B in the figure). Display the parent
        rows <em>below</em> their child rows (like <em>totals rows</em>).</p>
    <p><strong>Nested rows</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-21.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-21: Nested rows">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-21: Nested rows</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In <em>nested rows</em>, two types of rows are combined in such a way that the rows of one type repeat
        iteratively
        within every row of the other row type.</p>
    <p>Separate the resulting groups of rows by appropriate means, e.g. wider gaps (see additional gap B in the figure).

    <p><strong>Table types</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2: Table types">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2: Table types</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Table types are distinguished by their analytic purpose in time series tables, variance tables and cross tables.
        Tables serving more than one analytic purpose are called combined tables.</p>
    <p><strong>Time series tables</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-22.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-22: Time series tables">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-22: Time series tables</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Time series tables</em> are used for time series analyses, combining time columns with measure rows or
        structure rows.</p>
    <p>A typical example for a <em>time series table</em> is a sales analysis by countries (rows) and years (columns).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Variance tables</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-23.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-23: Variance tables">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-23: Variance tables</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Variance tables</em> are used for scenario analyses, combining scenario columns and variance columns with
        measure rows or structure rows.</p>
    <p>A typical example for a <em>variance table</em> is a sales analysis by countries (rows) showing different
        scenarios and different variances (columns).</p>
    <p><strong>Cross tables</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-24.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-24: Cross tables">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-24: Cross tables</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Cross tables</em> are used for Structure analyses, combining structure columns with structure rows.</p>
    <p>A typical example of a <em>cross table</em> is a sales table with countries in rows and products in columns.</p>
    <p><strong>Combined tables</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-25.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-25: Combined table 1">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-25: Combined table 1</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Combined tables</em> are used for multiple analyses. A combined table uses more than one <em>column type</em>
        and/or more than one <em>row type</em> presented either side by side or nested.</p>
    <p>The first figure shows a hierarchical structure of countries on three levels in the rows. The columns are nested:
        scenarios and variances are the same for both time periods <em>November</em> and <em>January_November</em>.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-1.2-26.png" alt="Figure EX 1.2-26: Combined table 2">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 1.2-26: Combined table 2</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The second figure shows the measures of a calculation scheme in the rows. The columns are nested: The four
        quarters and the annual total are the same for both years.</p>

    <p>The third figure shows the same rows as the second one (measures of a calculation scheme). The nested columns now
        show PY and AC data as well as absolute and relative variances for two markets.</p>
    <h3 id="ex-2-replace-inappropriate-chart-types">EX 2 Replace inappropriate chart types</h3>
    <p>Inappropriate charts make it hard to perceive the message. Knowing the correct usage of chart types helps in
        replacing inappropriate visualizations, such as pie charts, speedometer visualizations, radar charts, and
        spaghetti charts, with those chart types better suited.</p>
    <h3 id="ex-21-replace-pie-and-ring-charts">EX 2.1 Replace pie and ring charts</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-2.1.png" alt="Figure EX 2.1: Replace pie and ring charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 2.1: Replace pie and ring charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Pie</em> and <em>ring charts</em> are<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle">circular charts</a>
        dividing some total into<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_sector">sectors</a> of relative
        proportion, but there are better ways to illustrate the numericalproportions of segments, e.g. bar charts or
        charts with stacked columns, see Figure EX 2.1.</p>
    <p><em>Pie charts</em> allow for one-dimensional analyses only, and therefore seldom convey revealing insights.
        However, some useful applications for pie charts exist, for example when market sizes and/or market shares for
        one period need to be allocated to certain regions on a map (see CH 3.3 “<a
            href="#ch-33-avoid-misleading-colored-areas-in-maps">Avoid misleading colored areas in maps</a>”). As
        opposed to column or bar charts, pie charts can be positioned on a specific point on a map.</p>
    <h3 id="ex-22-replace-gauges-speedometers">EX 2.2 Replace gauges, speedometers</h3>

        <figcaption>Figure EX 2.2: Replace gauges, speedometers</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Often found as part of a so-called dashboard, <em>speedometers</em> are probably one of the most useless
        visualizations out there. They take up way too much space and have often confusing color coding and scaling. In
        general, bar charts showing the respective structures or columns charts showing the respective development over
        time are better choices, see Figure EX 2.2.</p>
    <h3 id="ex-23-replace-radar-and-funnel-charts">EX 2.3 Replace radar and funnel charts</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-2.3.png" alt="Figure EX 2.3: Replace radar and funnel charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 2.3: Replace radar and funnel charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>So-called <em>radar charts</em> (also called <em>net charts</em> or <em>spider charts</em>) are frequently used
        for
        evaluating purposes. Having no advantage over bar charts and having, actually, many weaknesses, use them only
        for two-dimensional analyses (e.g. comparing young-old with rich-poor). Willard C. Brinton wrote almost 100
        years ago: “This type of chart should be banished to the scrap heap. Charts on rectangular ruling are easier to
        draw and easier to understand.”</p>
    <p>Of course, if the circular arrangement has meaning (such as the compass direction), this kind of chart can be
        very valuable, but these types of analysis are not typical in business reporting.</p>
    <p><em>Funnel charts</em> are misleading when the size of the area displayed does not correspond to the respective
        numerical values – an issue applying also to other artificial chart forms (e.g. spheres) in which the length,
        area, or volume do not correspond to the numerical values.</p>
    <h3 id="ex-24-replace-spaghetti-charts">EX 2.4 Replace spaghetti charts</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/ex-2.4.png" alt="Figure EX 2.4: Replace spaghetti charts">
        <figcaption>Figure EX 2.4: Replace spaghetti charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A chart with more than three or four intersecting lines (“spaghetti chart”) can be more confusing than several
        smaller charts with one line each placed next to one another (small multiples), particularly when evaluating the
        shape or the trend of the lines, see Figure EX 2.4.</p>
    <p>However, when needing to compare exactly the height of data points of several lines, spaghetti charts cannot be
        avoided.</p>
    <h3 id="ex-25-replace-traffic-lights">EX 2.5 Replace traffic lights</h3>

        <figcaption>Figure EX 2.5: Replace traffic lights</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>“Traffic lights” with green, red, and yellow areas are a popular form of visualization but contain little
        information per area used. However, they can be used for analyses showing “yes or no” decisions or situations
        similar to real traffic lights. In all other cases replace them with more suitable means of (analog)
        representation such as bar charts, see Figure EX 2.5.</p>
    <h3 id="ex-3-replace-inappropriate-representations">EX 3 Replace inappropriate representations</h3>
    <p>From a perceptual perspective, avoid all visual representations requiring time consuming analyses or additional
        explanations, particularly the popular use of merely conceptual representations and all forms of texts,
        including bullet lists.</p>
    <h3 id="ex-31-prefer-quantitative-representations">EX 3.1 Prefer quantitative representations</h3>

        <figcaption>Figure EX 3.1: Prefer quantitative representations</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Due to the time constraints usually involved with presentations, conceptual graphs prove less suitable than
        charts, photos, maps, etc. For a one-hour presentation, do not use more than three or four conceptual
        representations. Do this only if they are absolutely essential for comprehension. The audience will understand
        charts and pictures (photos, drawings, etc.) better and faster, see Figure EX 3.1.</p>

        <figcaption>Figure EX 3.2: Avoid text slides in presentations</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Avoid all forms of text slides in presentations. Texts should either be recited or written in a handout. A few
        exceptions to this rule are specific texts being discussed such as definitions, quotes, etc. In general, all
        forms of lists (bullet points) should appear only in the written handout, not projected on the screen. True, if
        someone sees and hears something simultaneously, he remembers it better than when he just hears it, but bear in
        mind texts are not considered something merely to be seen – they must be read and understood, see Figure EX 3.2.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ex-4-add-comparisons">EX 4 Add comparisons</h3>
    <p>Visual perception is strongly based on setting one perceived object in relation to another. Adding meaningful
        comparisons helps the eye evaluate faster, the main purpose of charts.</p>

    <p>Scenarios such as “plan” and “previous year” are the most common references for comparison purposes. Add them

    <h3 id="ex-5-explain-causes">EX 5 Explain causes</h3>
    <p>Present data more understandable by showing interrelations, i.e. causes and dependencies. Seeing the entire
        context, especially extreme values and deviant values, helps to explain causes. Details increase not only the
        level of credibility but also comprehension. Use charts to prove, explain, and render something plausible, not
        to serve merely as decoration. This section focuses on the explanation of causes by using tree structures,
        clusters, and correlations. A more structured approach to increasing information density is discussed in the
        chapter “CONDENSE – Increase information density”.</p>

    <p>The presentation of the assumptions or basic data upon which a business analysis is based, results not only in
        better understanding, but also makes it more convincing. A good choice is the display of calculated measures in
        a tree structure, see Figure EX 5.1 (see also CO 5.2 “<a href="#co-52-show-related-charts-on-one-page">Show

    <p>With the help of clusters in two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms, large amounts of data very often can

    <p>Animated <em>PowerPoint</em> slides are not useful if the animation has no meaning and does not support the
        message, see Figure SI 1.3. They merely distract and confuse. Only the “appear” function is recommended to be
        used for the gradual development of a slide.</p>
    <h3 id="si-2-avoid-decorative-styles">SI 2 Avoid decorative styles</h3>
    <p>Simplify complicated visualizations in order to facilitate and accelerate their comprehension. Whereas the
        section “Avoid unnecessary components” involves omitting entire layout elements, the aim here is to find the
        most suitable and simplest possible style of visualization elements.</p>

        <figcaption>Figure SI 2.1: Avoid borders, shades, and pseudo-3D</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In general, borders, shades, and pseudo-3D convey no meaning and make comprehension more difficult. Shades and
        pseudo-3D might even give a false visual impression. Avoid them because they do not add value, see Figure SI

    </figure>
    <p>If colors serve merely decorative purpose in one instance, using them for meaning in another instance (e.g. for
        highlighting) becomes difficult. Therefore use colors only if they convey meaning, see Figure SI 2.2.</p>

    <p>Using integrated data labels can make value axes, tick marks, and gridlines superfluous, see Figure SI 3.1.
        Gridlines, however, can be useful in charts with missing reference points as might be the case in charts with
        many data series and data points, or in small charts (e.g. small multiples).</p>

    <p>Omit all avoidable elements to make tables more straightforward. Avoid vertical lines by right-aligning numerical
        values and the corresponding column headers, see Figure SI 3.2.</p>
    <h3 id="si-4-avoid-redundancies">SI 4 Avoid redundancies</h3>
    <p>Avoiding redundant terms usually increases the legibility of charts and tables. In some cases, a certain amount
        of redundancy can be helpful like when the time period named in the chart title also appears in said chart. But
        unnecessary redundancy impedes comprehension like when naming the year twelve times in a chart with twelve
        monthly category labels.</p>

        <figcaption>Figure SI 4.1: Avoid superfluous extra words</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Extra words such as “sum” and “total” are redundant because they add no value to the meaning of the term they
        accompany. No difference exists between “Europe” and “Sum of Europe”. Extra words make it harder to read text
        elements, see Figure SI 4.1.</p>

        <figcaption>Figure SI 4.2: Avoid obvious terms</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Terms such as “chart analysis”, “development”, or “comment” are redundant because they name something already
        shown, see Figure SI 4.2. Other obvious terms in charts and tables are “table”, “statistics”,
        “report”,“visualization”, “structure”, or “trend”.</p>

    <p>Repeated words in legends, axis labels, row headers, etc. such as“division” in “division A”, “division B”, etc.
        or “2017” in “Q1 2017”,“Q2 2017”, etc. should be avoided, see Figure SI 4.3. Omitting repeated words usually
        increases the degree of legibility.</p>
    <h3 id="si-5-avoid-distracting-details">SI 5 Avoid distracting details</h3>
    <p>In addition to avoiding noise and redundancy, omitting nonessential, distracting information details facilitates
        comprehension. Examples include unnecessarily large numbers and disproportionately detailed information in
        project or product overviews.</p>
    <h3 id="si-51-avoid-labels-for-small-values">SI 5.1 Avoid labels for small values</h3>

        <figcaption>Figure SI 5.1: Avoid labels for small values</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Labels of small values are often hard to position and rarely contribute to the comprehension of the message.
        Therefore they can be avoided in most cases, see Figure SI 5.1. However, add them when special reference is made
        to them. If it is necessary to label these small values or small visualization elements, <em>assisting
            lines</em>

    <p><em>Increasing information density</em> means that all reports and presentations include all information that is
        necessary to understand the respective message on one page.</p>
    <p>This chapter covers using small components, utilizing space, as well as adding data, elements, and objects.</p>

    <h3 id="co-1-use-small-components">CO 1 Use small components</h3>
    <p>The need for a higher level of information density requires to display all objects, elements, and signs as small
        as possible, while still being legible. Different technical parameters apply to printed material, screen
        displays, and projected slides.</p>
    <h3 id="co-11-use-small-fonts">CO 1.1 Use small fonts</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-1.1.png" alt="Figure CO 1.1: Use small fonts">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 1.1: Use small fonts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In general, avoid oversize fonts. They needlessly waste space, see Figure CO 1.1.</p>
    <h3 id="co-12-use-small-elements">CO 1.2 Use small elements</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-1.2.png" alt="Figure CO 1.2: Use small elements">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 1.2: Use small elements</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Small elements increase clarity. Large-scale symbols and highlights are not more suitable than smaller symbols
        and highlights, see Figure CO 1.2.</p>
    <h3 id="co-13-use-small-objects">CO 1.3 Use small objects</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-1.3.png" alt="Figure CO 1.3: Use small objects">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 1.3: Use small objects</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The size of charts and tables in reports and presentations should not be as large as possible, rather as small as
        possible – yet only so small so that the objects and all its details and labels can be read easily. This
        provides room for more information and therefore better understanding of the context, see Figure CO 1.3.</p>
    <h3 id="co-2-maximize-use-of-space">CO 2 Maximize use of space</h3>
    <p>Utilizing free space is the fastest and easiest way to increase information density. Make better use of
        needlessly wide margins and frames, or blank or little used pages by filling them with helpful data pertaining
        to the context.</p>
    <h3 id="co-21-use-narrow-page-margins">CO 2.1 Use narrow page margins</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-2.1.png" alt="Figure CO 2.1: Use narrow page margins">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 2.1: Use narrow page margins</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The page layout is often dominated by corporate design standards not made for high information density but for
        attractive design, sacrificing valuable space to layout elements such as extra wide page margins, see Figure CO
        2.1.</p>
    <h3 id="co-22-reduce-empty-space">CO 2.2 Reduce empty space</h3>

        <figcaption>Figure CO 2.2: Reduce empty space</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Reduce empty space to increase information density. This applies not only to the page layout (see Figure CO 2.1)
        but also to the layout of report objects such as charts and tables (see Figure CO 2.2).</p>
    <h3 id="co-3-add-data">CO 3 Add data</h3>
    <p>Adding more data to an existing visualization increases information density and helps better understand the
        context.</p>
    <h3 id="co-31-add-data-points">CO 3.1 Add data points</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-3.1.png" alt="Figure CO 3.1: Add data points">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 3.1: Add data points</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Displaying more data points does not jeopardize the comprehension of numerical data. For example, a monthly
        statistic of staff numbers over twelve months in a year would be understood just as quickly as for the same data
        series with twelve months for each of the last three years – in other words, a total of 36 data points instead
        of twelve. Usually, interesting relationships are only detected with an increased number of elements in a data
        series (see Figure CO 3.1).</p>
    <h3 id="co-32-add-dimensions">CO 3.2 Add dimensions</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-3.2.png" alt="Figure CO 3.2: Add dimensions">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 3.2: Add dimensions</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A very useful way to increase information density is to show more than two dimensions of a business situation. A
        chart with only one dimension (such as in a pie chart), visualizes only mundane things easily stated in a simple
        sentence. Already charts with two dimensions can yield very interesting relationships – yet those charts with
        three and more dimensions yield structures leading to completely new insights (see Figure CO 3.2).</p>
    <h3 id="co-4-add-elements">CO 4 Add elements</h3>
    <p>It is often appropriate to use two or more basic chart types (either horizontal or vertical) to build
        <em>combined
            charts</em> with a higher information density. <em>Combined charts</em> are treated as one entity as opposed
        to multiple charts. <em>Combined charts</em> can be built both out from horizontal or vertical charts.
    </p>
    <p>There are three types of combined charts depending on their type of combination:<em>Overlay
            charts</em>, <em>multi-tier charts</em>, and <em>extended charts</em>. Additionally, chart elements can be
        embedded in tables and explanations can be integrated.</p>
    <h3 id="co-41-show-overlay-charts">CO 4.1 Show overlay charts</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.1.png" alt="Figure CO 4.1: Show overlay charts">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.1: Show overlay charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In an <em>overlay chart</em>, two or more basic charts overlap. These overlapping charts always use the same
        category axis.</p>
    <p><em>Overlay charts</em> can facilitate comprehension such as in the combination of the development of sales (a
        series of columns) and the return on sales in percent (a line). However, this approach can only be used for a
        few chart combinations, see Figure CO 4.1.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.1-1.png"
            alt="Figure CO 4.1-1: Overlay chart with lines and columns using different valueaxes">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.1-1: Overlay chart with lines and columns using different valueaxes</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Overlay charts</em> frequently use different value axes. A <em>column chart</em> representing a measure (e.g.
        sales) combined with a <em>line chart</em> representing another measure (e.g. employees) is a typical example.
    </p>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.1-2.png"
            alt="Figure CO 4.1-2: Overlay chart with columns and lines using the same valueaxis">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.1-2: Overlay chart with columns and lines using the same valueaxis</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Sometimes, the same value axis is used as well. A <em>column chart</em> representing a measure (e.g. sales)
        combined with a <em>line chart</em> representing the same measure (e.g. industry average) is a typical example
        for such an <em>overlay chart</em>.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.1-3.png" alt="Figure CO 4.1-3: Overlay column chart with integratedvariances">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.1-3: Overlay column chart with integratedvariances</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Column or bar charts with <em>integrated variances</em> (variances displayed within the columns or bars) are
        other
        typical example for <em>overlay charts</em> using the same value axis (see the last two figures).</p>
    <p>Compared to two-tier charts, this presentation of two data series uses much less space. The disadvantages,
        though, are twofold: First, it is difficult to label the data of both the primary and secondary chart. Second,
        the development over time (horizontal axis) respectively the structure (vertical axis) of the primary chart is
        difficult to see.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.1-4.png" alt="Figure CO 4.1-4: Overlay bar chart with integratedvariances">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.1-4: Overlay bar chart with integratedvariances</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Suggestion: If there is enough space, use multi-tier charts instead.</p>
    <h3 id="co-42-show-multi-tier-charts">CO 4.2 Show multi-tier charts</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.2.png" alt="Figure CO 4.2: Show multi-tier charts">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.2: Show multi-tier charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Use multi-tier charts</em> to increase information density by adding additional tiers to the same category
        axis for analyses on the same basic data. Multi-tier charts are most frequently used for displaying variances
        along with the basic values, see Figure CO 4.2.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.2-1.png" alt="Figure CO 4.2-1: Horizontal multi-tier charts">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.2-1: Horizontal multi-tier charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In a <em>two-tier chart</em>, a <em>secondary chart</em> is shifted in parallel to the category axis of
        the <em>primary chart</em>. For horizontal charts the secondary chart appears above the primary chart, for
        vertical charts the secondary chart appears to the right of the primary chart.</p>
    <p>In both cases, the <em>category axes</em> of the primary charts are reduplicated in the secondary charts, usually
        having a different semantic scenario design.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.2-2.png" alt="Figure CO 4.2-2: Vertical multi-tier chart">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.2-2: Vertical multi-tier chart</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Both the primary and the secondary charts have their own value axes. Value axes showing the same currency or the
        same physical unit should be scaled identically.</p>
    <p>In a <em>three-tier chart</em> a third chart appears above a horizontal or to the right of a vertical two-tier
        chart. In special cases, more than three tiers can be combined.</p>
    <p>Improve the interpretation of a primary chart showing grouped bars for actual and plan data by adding variances.
        In the second and third figure a secondary chart with absolute variances and a tertiary pin chart with relative
        variances are combined.</p>
    <h3 id="co-43-show-extended-charts">CO 4.3 Show extended charts</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.3.png" alt="Figure CO 4.3: Show extended charts">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.3: Show extended charts</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>An <em>extended chart</em>, arranges additional charts next to the primary chart by virtually extending the
        category axis. This way of increasing information density often is used when displaying context information such
        as market averages or competitor figures, see Figure CO 4.3.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.3-1.png" alt="Figure CO 4.3-1: Horizontal extended chart">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.3-1: Horizontal extended chart</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For horizontal charts, additional charts appear to the left or right of the primary chart, for vertical charts,
        above or below. In both cases, position the <em>category axes</em> of the additional charts on a virtual
        extension of the category axes of the primary chart.</p>
    <p>In an extended chart, use the same value axis for both the primary and the additional charts.</p>
    <p>Improve the interpretation of a primary chart by adding extended charts showing the same values from a different
        perspective. In the figure on the left, a secondary <em>grouped column chart</em> at the right hand side shows
        the monthly average.</p>
    <h3 id="co-44-embed-chart-elements-in-tables">CO 4.4 Embed chart elements in tables</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.4.png" alt="Figure CO 4.4: Embed chart elements in tables">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.4: Embed chart elements in tables</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Increase the information density of tables by using <em>chart elements</em>, see Figure CO 4.4. Bars, warning
        dots, sparklines, and traffic lights are the predominant chart element types in tables.</p>
    <p><strong>Table bars</strong></p>
    <p><em>Table bars</em> are bar charts integrated into tables. The categories of these bar charts must correspond to
        the rows of a table. Both single bar charts with single bars or pins and waterfall bar charts are powerful means
        to visualize the absolute figures and variances in tables. Most recommendations concerning vertical chart types
        can be applied to <em>table bars</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning dots</strong></p>
    <p>Not to be confused with <em>traffic lights</em>, <em>warning dots</em> can be a good solution in highlighting
        important negative, positive, or questionable parts of a table. It is important to use only very few warning
        dots in one table.</p>
    <p><strong>Sparklines</strong></p>
    <p>Omit <em>sparklines</em> if not scaled properly. Individually scaled sparklines can be misleading because small
        fluctuations in a series of other small fluctuations look the same as big fluctuations in a series of big
        fluctuations. However, sparklines with proper scaling (e.g. indexed) can be helpful.</p>
    <p><strong>Traffic lights</strong></p>
    <p><em>Traffic lights</em> contain little information, as they represent no more than three (red, green, yellow)
        states. Use them only if there is no more information to be conveyed than those two or three states (e.g. “yes”
        or “no”). In all other cases, replace traffic lights with more suitable means of representation, such
        as <em>table bars</em>.</p>
    <h3 id="co-45-embed-explanations">CO 4.5 Embed explanations</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-4.5.png" alt="Figure CO 4.5: Embed explanations">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 4.5: Embed explanations</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Both the density of information and the level of comprehension increase when explanations are embedded into
        charts and tables (this applies to written reports and handouts only). When the explanation refers directly to
        the visual presentation in question, it helps to establish a connection and speeds up comprehension, see Figure
        CO 4.5.</p>
    <h3 id="co-5-add-objects">CO 5 Add objects</h3>
    <p>Reports and presentation material consist of one or more <em>pages</em>. The content of one page can be viewed
        together without referring to other content, e.g. flipping to other pages.</p>
    <p>Reports and presentation material often arrange more than one chart on one page. While this increases information
        density and fosters a higher level of comparability, it presents a design challenge: A uniform notation concept
        and consistent scaling are even more important than on pages with single charts.</p>
    <p>The most important types of pages with multiple objects are small multiples and multi-charts (including <em>ratio
            trees</em>).</p>
    <h3 id="co-51-show-small-multiples">CO 5.1 Show small multiples</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-5.1.png" alt="Figure CO 5.1: Show small multiples">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 5.1: Show small multiples</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Substantially improve the comprehension of complex relationships by displaying charts of the same type and the
        same scale on the same page. These charts are called <em>small multiples</em>, see Figure CO 5.1.</p>
    <p>Typical applications are charts with different countries, products, or projects placed next to each other. Of
        course, there is an upper limit to the number of charts on one page, depending mainly on the page- and font-size
        used.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/co-5.1-1.png" alt="Figure CO 5.1-1: Screen page with small multiples">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 5.1-1: Screen page with small multiples</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Showing <em>small multiples</em> is a good way to compare a set of up to around 25 charts. Instead of exceeding
        this number on one page, a new chart called “Others” containing the accumulation of all other elements could be
        a solution.</p>
    <p>As mentioned in the chapter “CHECK – Ensure visual integrity”, all small multiples must use the identical scale.
    </p>
    <p>Working with <em>small multiples</em> can be difficult if certain charts show significantly bigger values than
        others. Using a different scale for a chart with bigger values is not a feasible option, increase the size of
        this chart instead.</p>
    <h3 id="co-52-show-related-charts-on-one-page">CO 5.2 Show related charts on one page</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/co-5.2.png" alt="Figure CO 5.2: Show related charts on one page">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 5.2: Show related charts on one page</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Different from small multiples, <em>related charts cover different topics (different measures) on one page.</em>
        They mostly use different scales, too. This arrangement of charts on one page is sometimes
        called <em>multi-charts</em>. But the term <em>multi-charts</em> fails to underline the fact that these charts
        must have a useful relationship. It does not make sense to arrange several, completely unrelated charts on one
        page.</p>
    <p>This approach offers high data density and a higher level of comparability – but it can be a demanding visual and
        technical challenge as a uniform notation concept, clear terms, and an understandable scaling prove even more
        important (see Figure CO 5.2).</p>
    <figure><img src="img/co-5.2-1.png" alt="Figure CO 5.2-1: Page showing a ratio tree">
        <figcaption>Figure CO 5.2-1: Page showing a ratio tree</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Consistent scaling of <em>multi-charts</em> can be difficult. Sometimes different scales for the same unit or
        measure are inevitable. In this case, clearly indicate the use of a different scale by an appropriate mean, e.g.
        scaling indicators.</p>
    <p><em>Ratio trees</em> are multi-charts showing root causes. Use ratio trees to prove or explain a specific issue.
        Pointing out the assumptions and root causes of variances or temporal evolvements improves understanding and is
        more convincing, too. In general, the <em>ratio</em> is broken down into its components (mostly from left to
        right). Thus individual charts, preferably identical size, are arranged in a tree shape structure.</p>
    <p>Consistent scaling of <em>ratio trees</em> can be difficult. Sometimes different scales for the same unit or
        measure are inevitable. In this case, clearly indicate the use of a different scale by an appropriate mean, e.g.
        scaling indicators.</p>
    <p>A typical example of a page showing a <em>ratio tree</em> is the “Return on asset” tree.</p>
    <h3 id="co-53-show-chart-table-combinations">CO 5.3 Show chart-table combinations</h3>
    <p>Combining charts and tables on a page is not to be confused with the integration of chart elements in tables.</p>
    <p><em>Chart-table combinations</em> cover situations where a separate chart is added to a page with a table or vice
        versa. In general, such a combination is very useful if both objects display supplementary data. Tables simply
        listing the numbers of a chart are superfluous in most cases (see also UN 2.3 “<a
            href="#un-23-unify-the-position-of-legends-and-labels%E2%80%9D">Unify the position of legends and

    <p>Always position charts and tables in close proximity to the phrase carrying the message, which the chart or table

    <p>Charts serve as a means to visually compare numerical values. Manipulated axes defeat this purpose of explaining

    <p>Charts with value axes not starting at zero (“cut” axes) are not “wrong”in and of themselves, but the message to
        be visually conveyed then does not correspond to the numerical values upon which the chart is based. Therefore,
        value axes should generally start at zero, see Figure CH 1.1.</p>
    <p>One exception to this rule exists: charts with indexed data (e.g. if the value for the index period is set to
        100%) with only small variances from 100%. Here “zooming in” on the variances could be of greater value than
        indicating the absolute values (starting at zero). In this case, position the category labels at the 100% line
        in order to avoid misinterpretations.</p>

    <p>Creative visualization elements can be used to compare extreme values, e.g., displaying data in two-dimensional
        or even three-dimensional visualization elements allows the comparison of values differing by orders of
        magnitude, see Figure CH 2.2.</p>
    <p>This rule must be clearly separated from the rules of section CH 3 “<a
            href="#ch-3-avoid-misleading-representations">Avoid misleading representations</a>” where area and volume
        visualizations are used improperly.</p>
    <h3 id="ch-3-avoid-misleading-representations">CH 3 Avoid misleading representations</h3>
    <p>Graphical representations are misleading if the visual impression for the observer differs from the underlying
        values.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Using two-dimensional representations (areas of circles, icons, or emblems) for the visualization of data is only
        valid, if the size of these areas corresponds to the underlying values. The visual perception will be misleading
        if the diameters of circles or the heights of icons represent the values, see Figure CH 3.1.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Similar to areas, the visual perception will be misleading, if the (one-dimensional) diameters or the
        (two-dimensional) areas of three-dimensional visualization elements (spheres, cubes, etc.) represent the values,
        see Figure CH 3.2. Even if their volumes represent the values, it is hard to perceive them properly. Prefer
        linear comparisons instead.</p>

    <p>Different colored areas can be helpful to visualize the precipitation per square meter or the population density.
        However, do not use colored areas for the visualization of non-area-related figures such as market shares or
        return on sales. Position columns or bars of identical scale in maps instead. By the way, pie charts also work
        well here (an exception to the EX 2.1 “<a href="#ex-21-replace-pie-and-ring-charts">Replace pie...”</a> because
        they can be placed precisely at one point, like a city (see Figure CH 3.3).</p>
    <h3 id="ch-4-use-the-same-scales">CH 4 Use the same scales</h3>
    <p>Proper visual comparison requires the usage of identical scales for identical measure units, or – if this is not
        possible – a clear indication of the difference. If possible, use a consistent scaling concept for the complete
        report or presentation material.</p>

    <p>If presenting more than one chart of the same unit on one page, use the identical scale for these charts, see
        Figure CH 4.1. In extreme situations identical scales might not be desirable. In these exceptional cases the use
        of scaling indicators (see<a href="#ch-43-use-scaling-indicators-if-necessary">CH 4.3</a> and<a

    <p>Using identical scales in multiple charts can be demanding if the values in the charts differ by orders of

        <figcaption>Figure CH 4.3: Use scaling indicators if necessary</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>There are several ways to overcome challenging scaling problems. <em>Scaling indicators</em>, such as <em>scaling
            lines</em> and <em>scaling areas</em> indicating the same numerical height (typically a power of 10) in all
        charts are helpful to assist in comparing multiple charts (of the same unit) with different scales, see Figure
        CH 4.3.</p>
    <p>This guide suggests a <em>semantic design</em> for scaling lines and scaling areas, see UN 5.2 “<a
            href="#un-52-unify-scaling-indicators">Unify scaling indicators</a>”.</p>

        <figcaption>Figure CH 4.4: Use outlier indicators if necessary</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Certain values that are very big in comparison to other values are called outliers. If an outlier is not
        important for business, e.g. a big relative variance of a small value, then it is not appropriate to scale the
        whole chart to this outlier. Therefore, use <em>outlier indicators</em> for unimportant outliers, see Figure CH
        4.4.</p>
    <p>This guide suggests a <em>semantic design</em> for outlier indicators, see UN 5.3 “<a
            href="#un-53-unify-outlier-indicators">Unify outlier indicators</a>”.</p>
    <h3 id="ch-45-use-magnifying-glasses">CH 4.5 Use magnifying glasses</h3>
    <p>Another way to assist in scaling problems is to use “<em>magnifying glasses</em>” for zooming in on a part of a
        chart with a bigger scale. Use an appropriate visualization element to mark the part of a chart to be zoomed in
        and to link it to a second chart displaying the zoomed part on a bigger scale.</p>
    <h3 id="ch-5-show-data-adjustments">CH 5 Show data adjustments</h3>

    <h2 id="unify--apply-semantic-notation">UNIFY – Apply semantic notation</h2>
    <p>UNIFY covers all aspects of applying semantic notation in reports and presentations.</p>
    <p><em>Applying semantic notation</em> means that reports and presentations follow this governing
        principle:<em>Similar content should be visualized in a similar manner;</em> what looks the same should also
        mean the same. On the flip side: If the content is not the same, it should not look the same.</p>
    <p>In many specialized disciplines such as engineering, music, and architecture, <em>semantic notation
            standards</em>
        are a matter of course. The world of business communication lacks such notation standards, one of the main
        reasons management reports are sometimes hard to understand. For example, no common agreement on the meaning of
        various style elements such as titles, line markers, axes, highlighting indicators, etc. used in business charts
        exists yet.</p>
    <p>This chapter covers semantic rules for all important and frequently recurring aspects of meaning in the context
        of business communication, such as terminology (e.g. words, abbreviations, number formats), descriptions (e.g.
        messages, titles, legends), dimensions (e.g. measures, scenarios, time periods), analyses (e.g. comparisons and
        variances), and indicators for highlighting, scaling and other purposes.</p>

    <h3 id="un-1-unify-terminology">UN 1 Unify terminology</h3>
    <p><em>Terms</em> are the non-visual part of business communication. Unified <em>terms and abbreviations</em> as
        well
        as unified formats for <em>numbers, units and dates</em> accelerate understanding.</p>
    <h3 id="un-11-unify-terms-and-abbreviations">UN 1.1 Unify terms and abbreviations</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/un-1.1.png" alt="Figure UN 1.1: Unify terms and abbreviations">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 1.1: Unify terms and abbreviations</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The standardization of terms and abbreviations in reports and presentations is achieved by using an unambiguous
        language (see SA 4.2 “<a href="#sa-42-use-precise-words">Speak with precise words</a>“) and by unifying the
        usage of terms (glossary).</p>
    <p>Unify, compile and explain all terms and abbreviations used in reports and presentations in a clearly
        arranged <em>glossary</em> including abbreviations and definitions, see Figure UN 1.1.</p>
    <p>A glossary with terms and abbreviations in more than one language might be necessary in order to avoid different
        translations.</p>
    <p>Often the names of business measures are too long for charts and tables. Use abbreviations instead. It might be a
        good solution to define <em>short abbreviations</em> (e.g. to <em>A/R</em> for <em>Accounts Receivable</em> be
        used
        in table <em>column</em> headers) and <em>long abbreviations</em> (e.g. <em>Acc. Receiv.</em> to be used in
        table <em>row</em> headers).</p>
    <p>Unified terms and abbreviations for the notation of scenarios and time periods are covered in the respective
        sections.</p>
    <h3 id="un-12-unify-numbers-units-and-dates">UN 1.2 Unify numbers, units, and dates</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/un-1.2.png" alt="Figure UN 1.2: Unify numbers, units, and dates">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 1.2: Unify numbers, units, and dates</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The uniform use of formats for numbers, units and dates will enhance legibility, see Figure UN 1.2.</p>
    <p><strong>Numbers</strong></p>
    <p>Different languages and countries use different <em>number formats</em>, e.g. 1.234.567,00 (D); 1,234,567.00
        (USA); 1’234’567,00 or 1’234’567.00 (CH).</p>
    <p>It is important to unify the number formats in all reports and presentations. The <em>International System of
            Units (SI)</em> as described in “ISO 80000-1” recommends the following notation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thousand delimiter: 1 234 (blank space)</li>
        <li>Decimal sign: 1,23 or 1.23 (SI allows both versions)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do not use long numbers in order to avoid distraction and to concentrate on the essentials, see also SI 5.2 “<a
            href="#si-52-avoid-long-numbers">Avoid long numbers</a>”. Use <em>currency prefixes</em> and <em>metric
            prefixes</em> to limit the number of digits to a maximum of three in charts and four in tables.</p>
    <p>The most common formats for <em>negative values</em> are “-123” and “(123)”. Use the same format for all negative
        values.</p>
    <p><em>Positive values</em> do not have a plus sign, unless they represent variances.</p>
    <p><strong>Currencies</strong></p>
    <p>Use the standard <em>currency abbreviations</em> based on<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO
            4217</a>. ISO 4217 provides a set of currency abbreviations using three-letter acronyms such as EUR, CHF,
        USD, and GBP. The use of special currency symbols such as €, $, and ₤ is not recommended if a report includes
        many different currencies.</p>
    <p>Use “metric prefixes” in combination with the currency units for monetary values expressed in thousands or
        millions. Use lower case characters to differentiate the prefixes from the currency abbreviations and use single
        digit metric prefixes to save space, such as “k” for thousand, “m” for million and “b” for billion. The
        following shows the correct use of currency metric prefixes with EUR:</p>
    <p>1 bEUR = 1 000 mEUR = 1 000 000 kEUR = 1 000 000 000 EUR</p>
    <p>(The metric prefixes for physical units are “M” for “millions”and “G” for “billions”. Nevertheless, this guide
        suggests using “m” and“b” for currency metric prefixes, as “mEUR” and “bEUR” which is easier to understand than
        MEUR and GEUR.)</p>
    <p><strong>Physical units</strong></p>
    <p>For <em>physical units</em> use the<a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">International System of Units (SI)</a>
        such as kg, t, m, km, etc.</p>
    <p>In the case of non-monetary values expressed in thousands or millions, use<a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefixes">metric prefixes</a> suggested by the <em>International
            System of Units</em> such as “G” for billion, “M” for million, and “k” for thousand.</p>
    <p><strong>Dates</strong></p>
    <p><em>Dates</em> are best displayed using<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso_date">ISO 8601</a>, an
        international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data: YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. “2015-12-31”.</p>

    <h3 id="un-2-unify-descriptions">UN 2 Unify descriptions</h3>
    <p><em>Descriptions</em> are textual elements that describe the visual elements in reports and presentations
        facilitating comprehension. The following suggests unified layouts for every kind of <em>descriptions</em>.</p>
    <h3 id="un-21-unify-messages">UN 2.1 Unify messages</h3>

        <figcaption>Figure UN 2.1: Unify messages</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The <em>message</em> the author intends to convey to the reader or audience is best recognized, if the position
        and the layout of the message is always the same, see Figure UN 2.1.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-2.1-1.png" alt="Figure UN 2.1-1: Message text line">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 2.1-1: Message text line</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The <em>notation</em> of messages should be two text lines at the top of a report or presentation page, either a)
        above the title (see figure on the left) or b) right of the title. Position b) is not structured as clearly as
        position a) but it helps saving valuable vertical space especially on pages in landscape format.</p>
    <h3 id="un-22-unify-titles-and-subtitles">UN 2.2 Unify titles and subtitles</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/un-2.2.png" alt="Figure UN 2.2: Unify titles and subtitles">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 2.2: Unify titles and subtitles</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Titles</em> identify the content of pages and their objects in its entirety, omitting nothing necessary to
        understand the content, see Figure UN 2.2. In contrast to messages, titles do not contain any evaluating
        aspects, such as interpretations, conclusions, or propositions.</p>
    <p>If there is more than one object on a page, use <em>page titles</em> for entire pages, slides, or screens
        and <em>sub titles</em> for different objects on a page.</p>
    <p><strong>Page titles</strong></p>
    <p><em>Page titles</em> identify the content of a page. In general, three lines suffice to completely describe the
        content of a page:</p>
    <p><strong>Title line 1: Reporting unit</strong></p>
    <p>Element(s) of a structure dimension representing the object of the report, typically a legal entity, an
        organization unit, a line of business, a project, etc. or combinations thereof, e.g.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ABC Corporation</li>
        <li>ABC Corporation and its main competitors</li>
        <li>ABC Corporation, European division</li>
        <li>ABC Corporation, European division, Project B</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Add filter information if the elements are not exhaustive, e.g.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>International Chocolate Corporation, top ten clients</li>
        <li>International Chocolate Corporation, divisions with negative EBIT in 2016</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If title line 1 becomes too long its content can be split into two lines, e.g.</p>
    <blockquote>
        International Chocolate Corporation, European division<br>
        Top ten clients
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Title line 2: Business measure(s)</strong></p>
    <p>Element(s) of the measure dimension such as sales, profit, and shipment. Business measures are measured either in
        currency units (e.g. EUR, USD) or in physical units (e.g. #, kg, t). Use metric prefixes (e.g. k, m, b) where
        appropriate. Measures are written in bold font, their units are written in regular font. Examples are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Net sales</strong> in mEUR</li>
        <li><strong>Net sales</strong> in mEUR,<strong>margin</strong> in %</li>
        <li><strong>Headcount</strong> in #</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use a suiting name for a <em>set of measures</em>, if more than two measures have to be presented on one page.
        Examples are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Income statement</strong> in kEUR</li>
        <li><strong>ROI tree</strong> in mEUR</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced scorecard</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Product market portfolio</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use footnotes if parts of the measures are redundant or if parts of the measures are of minor importance for
        understanding. Examples are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Net sales</strong> in mEUR (without intercompany sales) – simpler:<strong>Net sales*</strong> in
            mEUR</li>
        <li><strong>Operating margin</strong> in mEUR (non-IFRS) – simpler:<strong>Operating margin*</strong> in mEUR
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Additional information</em> about the way presenting the content can help to understand better the respective
        page. They might concern structure dimensions, e.g.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profit</strong> in mUSD, by products</li>
        <li><strong>Net sales</strong> in kEUR, by products and by countries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>or they might be analytical annotations, e.g.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Net sales</strong> in mEUR and<strong>profit</strong>in mEUR, sorted by net sales (↓)</li>
        <li><strong>Full time equivalents</strong> in #, indexed (2012 = 100%)</li>
        <li><strong>Gross margin</strong> in kUSD, top ten</li>
    </ul>
    <p>or even combinations of structure dimensions and analytical annotations, e.g.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Net sales</strong> in mEUR, by countries, sorted by net sales (↓)</li>
        <li><strong>Full time equivalents</strong> in #, by offices, indexed (2012 = 100%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If title line 2 becomes too long its content can be split into two lines, e.g.:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Full time equivalents</strong> in #, by offices<br>
        Indexed (2012 = 100%)
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Net sales</strong> in mEUR, by countries<br>
        Sorted by net sales (↓)
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Title line 3: Time period(s) scenario(s), and variance(s)</strong></p>

    <p>Element(s) of the time dimension (e.g. years, months), of the <em>scenario</em> dimension (e.g. actual, plan),
        and
        variances (e.g. ΔPL, ΔPL%) if necessary.</p>
    <p>In general, elements of the <em>time</em> dimension (e.g. 2016, 2016-Q1) are necessary for understanding.
        Elements
        of the <em>scenario</em> dimension (e.g. AC, PL, FC) and <em>variances</em> are added if they help to understand
        the page content faster. If only actual values are presented, the attribute AC can be omitted.</p>
    <p>Display the time element first if both time and scenario elements are shown in title line 3.</p>
    <p>Use “&amp;” (ampersand sign) when title elements together make up a time series, e.g. “AC&amp;PL” (without
        blanks) if the first 8 months of a year present AC values and the last 4 months present PL values.</p>
    <p>Use “and” when different elements are presented for all time periods, e.g. “AC and PY” if all 12 months of a year
        present both AC and PY values.</p>
    <p>Examples of alternative arrangements in <em>title line 3</em> are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2017-Q1</li>
        <li>2016-03..2017-02</li>
        <li>2017 AC and PL</li>
        <li>2017 AC&amp;FC and PY</li>
        <li>2016 AC, 2017..2021 PL, or: 2014..21 AC&amp;PL, or: 2014..21</li>

    <p>Keep it clear and easy to understand – too many elements tend to be confusing. In many cases the information
        depicted in column headers of tables and legends of data series in charts are sufficient and give better and
        quicker insight than long texts in <em>title line 3</em>. In any case, rules for abbreviating time periods and
        dates as well as the rules for abbreviating scenarios and variances must be followed.</p>
    <p>In general, position <em>page titles</em> at the very upper left corner of a page, directly underneath the
        message
        (if a message exists). Alternatively, position them at the same height as the message if there is not enough
        space – preferably on the left hand side of the message.</p>
    <p>Here are some typical examples of <em>page titles</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        Chocolate Corp.<br>
        <strong>Gross profit</strong> in mUSD<br>
        2016
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Construction Inc., Division EMEA<br>
        <strong>Net sales</strong> in mEUR, <strong>profit margin</strong> in %<br>
        _2016-Q3 (AC, PL)
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Beverage Corporation<br>
        <strong>Product market portfolio</strong><br>
        2015 and 2016
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Milk & Cheese Corp.<br>
        <strong>Shipments</strong> in t, by product, by country<br>
        2016-W01..10
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Subtitles</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-2.2-2.png" alt="Figure UN 2.2-2: Subtitles">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 2.2-2: Subtitles</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Subtitles</em> identify either page segments or objects (e.g. charts and tables) within a page with multiple
        objects. They complement the identification information already given in the page title. Subtitles display
        identifiers that differ from object to object on a page. Put identifiers that are identical for all objects of a
        page in the page title and not in the subtitles.</p>
    <p>In most cases, one line is sufficient for subtitles because different elements of only one dimension have to be
        identified. Typical examples are:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Revenue</strong> in mEUR<br>
        Apples<br>
        2014..2016
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Sales</strong> in SKU<br>
        Pears<br>
        2016-Q1..Q4
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Avg. price</strong> in EUR/SKU<br>
        Oranges<br>
        2016-10..12
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>Subtitles</em> are positioned above the respective objects (charts, tables, etc.) which they identify –
        either centered or left-aligned.</p>
    <p><strong>Titles on screen pages</strong></p>
    <p>Unlike titles on printed pages, the layout of titles on screen pages can depend on the device (responsive
        design). For small devices in landscape format e.g. writing the three title lines in one line separated by a “|”
        (pipe sign) is a valid solution.</p>
    <p>Titles on screen pages can also mutually interfere with interactive navigation objects such as drop-down boxes
        for selection and check boxes for filtering. These navigation objects can contain redundant title information,
        but they cannot replace the title or parts of it. Hide these navigation objects when they are not in use or when
        the screen page is being printed.</p>

    <p>A standardized notation of <em>legends</em> and <em>labels</em> will improve legibility and speed up
        comprehension
        of charts, see Figure UN 2.3.</p>
    <p><strong>Legends</strong></p>
    <p><em>Legends</em> (also called “<em>data series labels</em>”) identify data series.</p>
    <p>If possible, integrate legends into charts, not positioned externally. Write legends horizontally for better
        legibility.</p>
    <p>Legends for single column charts and single bar charts are best integrated into the title.</p>

    <p><em>Assisting lines</em> can help to assign the legends to the correct <em>visualization elements</em>. In

        <figcaption>Figure UN 2.3-5: Legends in a chart with two value axes</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For charts with two value axes, externally positioned legends next to symbols can be a good choice. When helpful,
        integrate these legends into the chart by positioning them next to typical points or bubbles.</p>
    <p><strong>Labels</strong></p>
    <p><em>Labels</em> (more precise:<em>data labels</em>) assign the data values to the respective visualization
        elements.</p>
    <p>Omit labels of small visualization elements, use labels with not more than three digits, and avoid unnecessary
        and distracting labels (see also the SIMPLIFY rules SI 5 “<a href="#si-5-avoid-distracting-details">Avoid
            distracting details</a>”).</p>
    <p>Write labels horizontally for better legibility.</p>
    <p>Position labels next to their visualization elements. If this is not possible, use lines connecting the labels to
        the correct visualization elements.</p>

    <p>In charts with horizontal category axes, position labels above or below the visualization elements, see the first

    <p>Mainly in static reports, <em>comments</em> detail other elements (e.g. definitions of data series) and objects
        such as charts and tables. Sometimes comments also refer to complete pages.</p>
    <p>The level of comprehension increases when comments refer directly to the visual representation. Therefore,
        comments on an object (e.g. chart) are integrated into that object when possible. Comment elements should be

    <p>Data in reports and presentations can be viewed from various perspectives called <em>dimensions</em>. For
        example,
        all business measures, such as sales, profit, margin, etc., constitute a measure dimension, all months,
        quarters, years, etc., a time dimension.</p>
    <p>Identifying dimensions via uniform visualization will help to understand reports and presentations.</p>

        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.1: Unify measures</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Business <em>measures</em> such as sales, profit, margin, etc. describe, report, and calculate business
        situations. A standardized notation will help to comprehend the specific characteristics of measures, e.g.
        whether they are basic measures or calculated ratios of measures, whether they represent value or volume
        figures, flow or stock figures, or whether they have a positive or negative impact, see Figure UN 3.1.</p>
    <p>The <em>visualization</em> of business measures is presented here. Their <em>definition</em>, generally given in
        accounting manuals or similar documentation, is not discussed here.</p>
    <p><strong>Basic measures and ratios</strong></p>
    <p><em>Basic measures</em> such as “export sales” are directly derived from business processes. <em>Ratios</em> such
        as “return on sales” are quotients of two basic measures.</p>
    <p><strong>Basic measures</strong></p>
    <p>Basic measures have either <em>currency units</em> (e.g. EUR) or <em>physical units</em> (e.g. kg). They are
        neither shares of something (percentages) nor quotients of two measures.</p>

    <p>Use 2/3 of the category width for the column width in <em>column charts</em> and the bar width in <em>bar

    </figure>
    <p>Use thick lines for representing basic measures in <em>line charts</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Ratios</strong></p>
    <p><em>Ratios</em> are quotients of two basic measures such as “return on sales”. In practice, few denominators
        exist: “Sales”, “units sold”, “headcount”, and “capital”constitute the majority of all business ratios.</p>
    <p>If both the enumerator and denominator have the same unit the resulting ratio has no unit. It is expressed
        in <em>percent</em> (e.g. “profit in % of sales”).</p>
    <p>In addition, if both enumerator and denominator have the same basic measure (e.g. “headcount”), it is called
        a <em>share</em>(e.g. “gender share”).</p>

        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.1-3: Monthly ratios in a column chart</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The width of both bars and columns representing <em>ratios</em> is 1/3 of the category width, i.e. 50% of the
        width of bars and columns representing <em>basic measures</em>.</p>

    <p>Represent ratios in <em>line charts</em> with thin lines (50% of thick lines).</p>
    <p><strong>Value and volume</strong></p>
    <p><em>Value</em> measures such as “profit” and “capital” have currency units. <em>Volume</em> measures such as
        “shipment” and “headcount” have physical units.</p>
    <p><strong>Flow and stock</strong></p>
    <p><em>Flow</em> measures like “net sales” relate to a certain <em>time period</em> such as months or
        years. <em>Stock</em> measures like “inventory” relate to a certain <em>fixed date</em>, such as December 31st
        of
        2015 (at midnight).</p>
    <p><strong>Positive, negative, and neutral impact</strong></p>
    <p>An increase of a <em>positive measure</em> such as “profit” or “sales” positively impacts the organization’s
        result.</p>
    <p>An increase of a <em>negative measure</em> such as “cost” or “waste” negatively impacts the organization’s
        result.
    </p>
    <p>An increase of <em>neutral measures</em> such as “market size” or “investment” has no direct impact to the
        organization’s result.</p>
    <h3 id="un-32-unify-scenarios">UN 3.2 Unify scenarios</h3>

        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.2: Unify scenarios</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Scenarios</em>(also called data categories, data types, or versions) represent different layers of a business
        model. Typical scenarios are “Actual”, “Previous year”, “Plan”, “Budget”, and“Forecast”. In special
        cases <em>benchmarks</em> such as competitor data or market averages are also called scenarios.</p>
    <p>Often comparisons and variances between different scenarios are presented to provide business insights.</p>
    <p>There are two basic types of scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Actual scenarios</strong> refer to <em>measured</em> data about things that already happened in
                present or past time periods. These data might not be perfectly correct because of difficulties with
                systems, unclear definitions, and false data acquisition – but they are as correct as possible. The
                terms we use most often for scenarios of this type are ‘Actual’ and ‘Previous year’.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Planned scenarios</strong> refer to <em>fictitious</em> (not materialized) data. The terms we use
                most often for scenarios of this type are ‘Plan’ and ‘Budget’.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In-between those two basic scenario types there is a third one:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Forecasted scenarios</strong> refer to <em>expected</em> data which are strictly speaking fictitious
            but already taking into account measured data. A typical example forexpected data is the sales forecast
            based on the measured order entry. Forecasted scenarios represent a higher level of certainty than scenarios
            with planned data but are not completely materialized yet. The term we use most often for scenarios of this
            type is ‘Forecast’.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When analyzing charts and tables, it is very important to quickly recognize whether you look at measured,
        expected, or fictitious data. Readers can visually recognize these scenario types by looking at the <em>area
            fill</em> of a visualization element without having to read the labels. Typical chart visualization elements
        such as bars, columns, line chart markers, scenario triangles, etc. carry the semantic scenario notation.</p>
    <p>In charts presenting variances, their <em>axes</em> carry the semantic scenario notation in order to show the
        respective reference scenario (see<a href="#un-41-unify-scenario-analyses">UN 4.1</a>).</p>
    <p>In charts with stacked columns, stacked areas, and charts with multiple lines or areas, the application of this
        semantic scenario notation can become a challenge. In these cases, applying the semantic notation to the axis
        instead of the columns etc. is a valid option.</p>
    <p><strong>Actual scenarios: measured data</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-3.2-1.png" alt="Figure UN 3.2-1: Visualization of measured data">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.2-1: Visualization of measured data</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Scenarios with measured data are identified by a solid dark (e.g. black or dark gray) fill for the areas of the
        respective visualization elements.</p>
    <p>If measured data of recent periods (“Actual”) are compared with measured data from earlier periods (e.g.
        “Previous year”,“Previous month’”, “Month YoY”) the areas representing the earlier periods are identified by a
        lighter solid fill (e.g. light gray).</p>
    <p>The suggested two-letter codes for the most important measured data scenarios are “AC” for “Actual” and “PY” for
        “Previous Year”.</p>
    <p><strong>Planned scenarios: fictitious data</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-3.2-2.png" alt="Figure UN 3.2-2: Visualization of fictitious data">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.2-2: Visualization of fictitious data</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Scenarios with fictitious data are identified by bordered (outlined, framed) areas of the respective
        visualization elements. The areas within these borders literally “fill up when materializing”, e.g. when
        changing from fictitious data to measured data.</p>
    <p>The suggested two-letter codes for the two most important fictitious data scenarios are “PL” for “Plan” and “BU”
        for“Budget”.</p>
    <p><strong>Forecasted scenarios: expected data</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-3.2-3.png" alt="Figure UN 3.2-3: Visualization of expected data">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.2-3: Visualization of expected data</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Expected data is strictly speaking fictitious, so they are also identified by bordered (outlined, framed) areas.
        However, as it is based on measured data, the area fill of the respective visualization elements becomes
        hatched. The color of the dark stripes correspond to the color of measured data (e.g. dark gray).</p>
    <p>The suggested two-letter code for the most important expected data scenario is “FC” for “Forecast”.</p>

        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.3: Unify time periods and points of time</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Using standard notations for <em>time periods</em> (for flow measures) and <em>points of time</em> (for stock
        measures) is important as they are frequently applied to all forms of business communication. This requires
        standard notations for the visual direction of time, time period and points of time abbreviations and – in
        charts with horizontal time axes – category widths, see Figure UN 3.3.</p>
    <p><strong>Visual direction of time periods</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-3.3-1.png" alt="Figure UN 3.3-1: Visual direction of time periods">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.3-1: Visual direction of time periods</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>As opposed to structural comparisons, horizontal axes visualize data series over time. In tables, present data
        series over time in columns. In both cases time moves from left to right.</p>
    <p><strong>Time period and points of time abbreviations</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-3.3-2.png" alt="Figure UN 3.3-2: Time period and points of timeabbreviations">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.3-2: Time period and points of timeabbreviations</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For a better understanding, use unified <em>abbreviations for time periods and points in time</em>. ISO 8601
        recommends the following pattern for time periods: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2017-05-13) for its unambiguousness and easy
        sorting. The <em>abbreviations</em> in the figure.</p>
    <p>In some countries or organizations other abbreviations such as Oct 2017, Q2 2017, W07 2017 are common. They can
        also be used as long as they are used consistently.</p>
    <p>A “.” (full-stop) before the period name indicates the <em>first day</em> of a time period, e.g. “.2017” for the
        first day of 2017 or “.Jun” for the first day of June.</p>
    <p>Likewise, append “.” (full-stop) to the period name to visualize the <em>last day</em> of a time period, e.g.
        “2017.” for the last day of 2017 or “Jun.” for the last day of June.</p>
    <p>The sign “..” (two full-stops) indicates a <em>time span,</em> e.g. “Jan..Mar” (without blanks) for “from January
        to March.”N.B.: Use two dots instead of three dots (“ellipsis”).</p>
    <p><strong>Category widths</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-3.3-3.png" alt="Figure UN 3.3-3: Category widths">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 3.3-3: Category widths</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When helpful, differentiate different types of time periods with different <em>category widths</em> according to
        this rule: the longer the period the wider the category segments on the category axis.</p>
    <p>It might be necessary to use rather <em>wide</em> category segments to label stacked columns or
        rather <em>narrow</em> category segments due to restricted dashboard space. In any case, if certain period types
        have been allocated certain category widths, this allocation should be the same for the entire report or
        presentation.</p>

    <p><em>Analyze scenarios</em> by comparing them and by calculating their absolute and relative variances. Notation
        standards for scenario analyses cover the labelling of variances and the semantic design of chart elements such
        as columns, bars, and axes, see Figure UN 4.1.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario comparisons</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.1-1.png" alt="Figure UN 4.1-1: Scenario comparisons">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.1-1: Scenario comparisons</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Scenario comparisons</em> place the data of different scenarios next to each other, for example actual data
        next to previous year or budget data. This is relevant for both charts and tables. In tables, scenarios usually
        are shown in columns.</p>
    <p>Scenarios can be compared in an absolute or relative way:</p>
    <p>Absolute variance = primary scenario – reference scenario</p>
    <p>Relative variance = absolute variance / reference scenario</p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.1-2.png" alt="Figure UN 4.1-2: Column charts with scenario comparisons">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.1-2: Column charts with scenario comparisons</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Arrange scenarios of <em>different time periods</em> (mainly years) in temporal ascending order either from left
        to right (horizontal axes) or from above to below (vertical axes), e.g. PY (= AC 2014), FC 2015, PL 2016.</p>
    <p>No rule governs the sequence of scenarios referring to the <em>identical time period</em> – e.g. PL 2015, FC
        2015,
        AC 2015, but the selected sequence should be kept the same in all charts and tables.</p>
    <p><em>Scenario comparisons</em> are visualized either by grouping columns or bars (e.g. overlapping columns of PY
        and AC or overlapping bars of PL and AC), or with <em>scenario triangles</em> using the respective area coding
        (e.g. solid light color for PY) to represent the reference scenario. <em>Scenario triangles</em> can also be
        added to overlapped bars or columns in order to show a third scenario.</p>
    <p>The scenarios AC and FC stand in the foreground of other scenarios in grouped columns or bars.</p>
    <p><strong>Absolute variances</strong></p>
    <p>An <em>absolute variance</em> is the difference between two values of one measure from different scenarios.</p>
    <p>The sign “Δ” represents the absolute variance as a prefix to the subtrahend of the respective difference, i.e.
        “ΔPL” for the absolute difference “AC minus PL” (AC-PL) or – if FC is compared to PL – “FC minus PL” (FC-PL).
    </p>
    <p>The most common <em>absolute variances</em> are the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Plan variance:</strong> “ΔPL” for AC-PL or FC-PL (when comparing FC to PL)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Previous year variance:</strong> “ΔPY” for AC-PY or FC-PY (when comparing FC to PY)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If it is not clear whether AC or FC is compared to plan in ΔPL or ΔPY, use the following notation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan variance:</strong> “AC-PL” and “FC-PL”</li>
        <li><strong>Previous year variance</strong>: “AC-PY” and “FC-PY”</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Positive absolute variances</em> (as well as positive percent variances) have a “+” to emphasis this aspect:
        “+13” always means a <em>variance</em> of 13, “13” means any absolute value of 13.</p>
    <p>If absolute variances are displayed in columns or bars (“variance columns” or “variance bars”), these variance
        columns or bars have the same width and the same scale as the corresponding base value columns or bars.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.1-3.png" alt="Figure UN 4.1-3: Colors for displaying variances">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.1-3: Colors for displaying variances</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Variance bars and columns representing a <em>positive impact</em> on business issues (mainly result) are colored
        green, those representing a <em>negative impact</em> red, see figure on the left. Variance bars and columns
        representing a <em>neutral impact</em> are colored medium gray. If no color is available, replace red with dark
        gray, green with light gray. For readers with color deficiency, replace green with blue-green.</p>
    <p>If it is helpful, numbers in tables representing variances are colored in the same way.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: These colors for positive, negative, or neutral variances must not be confused with red
        and green “traffic lights” (see also EX 2.5 “<a href="#ex-25-replace-traffic-lights">Replace traffic
            lights</a>”).</p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.1-4.png" alt="Figure UN 4.1-4: Bar charts with absolute variances">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.1-4: Bar charts with absolute variances</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In order to visualize the <em>scenario to be analyzed</em> (minuend), apply scenario notation to the fill of the
        variance columns or bars, e.g. <em>solid</em> green or red fill for AC and <em>hatched</em> green or red fill
        for
        FC. If in special cases the minuend is PL (e.g. variance of plan versus average) the variance columns and bars
        are <em>outlined</em> green or red.</p>
    <p>Position data labels for variance columns and bars always <em>outside</em> of these visualization elements. These
        labels’ position aligns with the direction of positive or negative increase, i.e. the label of a positive
        variance (green) in a variance column is positioned above the column; the label of a negative variance (red) on
        the left hand side outside of the bar.</p>
    <p>In order to visualize the <em>reference scenario</em> (subtrahend) of an absolute variance (in general PY, PL, or
        BU), apply scenario notation to the axis: For absolute variances to PY the axis is colored solid light, for
        absolute variances to PL or BU the axis takes an outline shape (two parallel lines).</p>
    <p>Treat variances of ratios, e.g. percent values (profit on sales) in a special way: Absolute variances of percent
        values are called <em>percent points</em>, e.g. AC 50% – PL 40% = +10pp.</p>
    <p><strong>Relative variances</strong></p>
    <p>A <em>relative variance</em> is an absolute variance as a percentage of the subtrahend of the absolute variance.
    </p>
    <p>For the textual notation of relative variances, use the sign “Δ”as a prefix to the subtrahend and the sign “%” as
        appendix, e.g. ΔPL% for the relative variance (AC-PL)/PL*100.</p>
    <p>The most common <em>relative variances</em> are the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Plan variance</strong>: “ΔPL%” for (AC-PL)/PL*100 or (FC-PL)/PL*100 (when comparing FC to PL)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Previous year variance</strong>: “ΔPY%” for (AC-PY)/PY*100 or (FC-PY)/PY*100 (when comparing FC
                to PY)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Display “n.a.” (not available) if the calculated relative variance cannot be interpreted, as is often the case
        when a positive value is compared to a negative reference value (denominator):</p>
    <pre><code>Profit AC = 30
Profit PL = -30
ΔPL = +60
ΔPL% = 60 /
-30 = -200% => n.a.</code></pre>
    <p>Use the following notation, if it is not clear whether AC or FC is compared to Plan:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan variance</strong>: “(AC-PL)%” and “(FC-PL)%”</li>
        <li><strong>Previous year variance</strong>: “(AC-PY)%” and “(FC-PY)%”</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Positive relative variances</em> (as well as positive absolute variances) have a “+”-to emphasize this
        aspect: “+13%”always means a <em>variance</em> of 13%, “13%” means any kind of percentage such as ratio or a
        share.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.1-5.png" alt="Figure UN 4.1-5: Columns charts with relative variances">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.1-5: Columns charts with relative variances</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Relative variances are displayed in thin columns (vertical pins) or thin bars (horizontal pins), see the two
        figures on the left.</p>
    <p>Pins representing a <em>positive impact</em> on business issues (mainly result) are colored green, those
        representing a <em>negative impact</em> red. Pins representing a <em>neutral impact</em> on business issues are
        colored medium gray. If no color is available, replace red with dark gray, green with light gray. For readers
        with color deficiency, replace green with blue-green.</p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.1-6.png" alt="Figure UN 4.1-6: Bar charts with relative variances">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.1-6: Bar charts with relative variances</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The labels of pins and the numbers representing variances in tables can be colored in the same way.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: These colors for positive, negative, or neutral variances must not be confused with red
        and green “traffic lights” (see also EX 2.5 “<a href="#ex-25-replace-traffic-lights">Replace traffic
            lights</a>”).</p>
    <p>Position data labels of pins outside the pin in the direction of the positive or negative increase, e.g. position
        the label of a horizontal pin depicting “sales growth in %” (green) on the right hand side of the pin, position
        the label of a vertical pin depicting “cost decrease in %” (green) below the pin.</p>
    <p>Add head markers to the pins to visualize the <em>scenario to be analyzed</em> (minuend). Apply the scenario
        notation to the fill of the heads, e.g. solid dark fill for AC and hatched fill for FC.</p>
    <p>Apply the scenario notation to the axis in order to visualize the <em>reference scenario</em> for a relative
        variance (in general PY, PL, or BU): For relative variances to PY fill the axis solid light, for relative
        variances to PL or BU the axis takes an outline shape (two parallel lines).</p>
    <p>Treat relative variances of percent values the same way as relative variances of absolute values, e.g. (AC 50% –
        PL 40%) / PL 40% * 100 = +25%.</p>
    <h3 id="un-42-unify-time-series-analyses">UN 4.2 Unify time series analyses</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.2.png" alt="Figure UN 4.2: Unify time series analyses">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.2: Unify time series analyses</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Notation for <em>time series analyses</em> covers year-to-date analyses, moving analyses, and temporal indexing,
        see Figure UN 4.2.</p>
    <p><strong>Year-to-date analyses</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.2-1.png" alt="Figure UN 4.2-1: Year-to-date analyses">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.2-1: Year-to-date analyses</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Year-to-date analyses</em> (YTD) refer to the period from the beginning of the year to the present (<em>YTD
            time span</em>). The beginning of the year is not necessarily January 1. Some companies have fiscal years
        beginning at other dates.</p>
    <p>Where helpful, visualize analyses showing YTD values by prefixing an underscore to the <em>time period name</em>,
        e.g. “_Jun 2015”or “_Jun∅” respectively. Optionally, add the first period of the YTD time span, e.g.
        “January_June 2015”. In charts, add the underscores as a prefix at the left hand side of the end of the columns
        or at the upper side of the end of bars.</p>
    <p>Year-to-date operations cover accumulation of values, calculation of averages, and picking of last date values.
    </p>
    <p><strong>YTD accumulation</strong></p>
    <p>In this context, <em>accumulation</em> means totaling successive time period values from the beginning of a
        calendar year or fiscal year to the present. In this stricter sense, accumulation applies only to flow measures,
        such as sales or costs.</p>
    <p>If it is helpful, visualize analyses showing <em>YTD accumulation</em> with the underscore prefix (without
        additional notation) e.g. “_Jun 2015”.</p>
    <p><strong>YTD average</strong></p>
    <p>In this context, the <em>average</em> is calculated by dividing the <em>YTD accumulation</em> by the number of
        periods in the <em>YTD time span</em>. YTD average applies to both <em>flow</em> and <em>stock measures</em>.
    </p>
    <p>If it is helpful, visualize analyses showing <em>YTD averages</em> with the underscore prefix and an appended
        “∅”sign, e.g. “_Jun 2015∅”.</p>
    <p><strong>Last date value</strong></p>
    <p>A special YTD analyses for stock measures is picking the <em>value of the last date</em> in the <em>YTD time
            span</em>.</p>
    <p>If it is helpful, visualize analyses showing <em>last date values</em> with the underscore prefix and an appended
        full-stop, e.g. “_Jun 2015.”.</p>
    <p><strong>Year-to-go analyses</strong></p>
    <p>By analogy to year-to-date analyses, <em>year-to-go analyses</em> (YTG) refer to the period from the presence
        (now) to the end of the (fiscal) year.</p>
    <p>Where helpful, visualize analyses showing YTG values by appending an underscore to the <em>time period name</em>,
        e.g.“Jun-2015_”.</p>
    <p><strong>Moving analyses</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.2-2.png" alt="Figure UN 4.2-2: Moving analysis labeling in a column chart">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.2-2: Moving analysis labeling in a column chart</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In general, <em>moving analyses</em> refer to the period of the previous twelve months.</p>
    <p>If it is helpful, visualize moving analyses by prefixing the <em>time period name</em> with a tilde, e.g. “~Jun
        2015” or “~Jun∅” respectively. In charts, add the tilde as a prefix at the left hand side of the end of columns
        or the upper side of the end of bars.</p>
    <p>Similar to year-to-date operations, moving analyses cover accumulation of values (<em>moving annual total</em>
        MAT), calculation of averages (<em>moving annual average</em> MAA), and picking of last date values.</p>
    <p>The visualization concept for <em>accumulation of values</em>, <em>calculation of averages</em>, and <em>picking
            of
            last date values</em> is identical to the visualization concept of year-to-date analyses – the tilde simply
        replaces the underscore.</p>
    <p><strong>Temporal indexing</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.2-3.png" alt="Figure UN 4.2-3: Visualizing temporal indexing">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.2-3: Visualizing temporal indexing</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Using <em>temporal indexing</em> (indexing a time series), all period values are depicted in relation to the
        value
        of a chosen reference period (1 or 100%).</p>
    <p>To visualize temporal indexing, position a black arrowhead pointing right at the left of the index point. “100%”
        or “100”is written left of the arrowhead. If helpful, add an assisting horizontal line.</p>
    <h3 id="un-43-unify-structure-analyses">UN 4.3 Unify structure analyses</h3>
    <p>Notation for <em>structure analyses</em> covers averaging, ranking, selecting, indexing, and normalizing.</p>
    <p><strong>Structural average</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.3-1.png" alt="Figure UN 4.3-1: Visualizing structural averaging">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.3-1: Visualizing structural averaging</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The term “<em>average</em>” usually refers to the mean of different values. The section time series analyses
        described <em>temporal averages</em> (e.g. monthly average of a year). <em>Structural averages</em> (e.g.
        average
        sales of several subsidiaries) are covered here. Typical structural averages are average by product, average by
        country, and average by customer.</p>
    <p>Visualize analyses showing structural averages with a “Ø” sign either appended or as a prefix, e.g. “EuropeØ” or
        “Ø464”. If needed, add an assisting line.</p>
    <p><strong>Ranking</strong></p>
    <p><em>Ranking</em> analyses refer to descending or ascending rankings of structure elements. Words can be ranked in
        alphabetical order, numbers in numerical order.</p>
    <p>If helpful, append an arrow sign to rankings, e.g. “country names↓” or “product sales↑”.</p>
    <p><strong>Selecting</strong></p>
    <p>The structure analysis <em>selecting</em> is related to the structure analysis <em>ranking</em>, used, in
        general,
        to determine either maximal (fastest, most expensive) elements or the minimal (slowest, cheapest) elements. Top
        ten, last ten, first quartile, last percentile, etc., are common forms of selecting.</p>
    <p><strong>Structural indexing</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.3-2.png" alt="Figure UN 4.3-2: Visualizing structural indexing">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.3-2: Visualizing structural indexing</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Structural indexing</em> depicts all element values in relation to the value of a chosen reference element
        (=1 or 100%). Typical reference elements are the mean, the maximum, or a specific element in a given structure,
        e.g. “Germany = 100%”.</p>
    <p>To visualize <em>structural indexing</em>, position a black arrowhead close to the index point. “100%” or “100”,
        is written next to the arrowhead. If helpful, add an assisting line.</p>
    <p><strong>Structural normalizing</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-4.3-3.png" alt="Figure UN 4.3-3: Visualizing structural normalizing">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 4.3-3: Visualizing structural normalizing</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><em>Structural normalizing</em> refers to the comparison of several shares of some whole, e.g. shares of export
        to different countries. Indexing and normalizing are similar analyses, indexing refers to one element (e.g. a
        selected country), normalizing to the whole of several parts (e.g. country sales in % of Europe sales).</p>
    <p>To visualize <em>structural normalizing</em>, add an assisting line representing 100%. Position a black arrowhead
        at one end of the assisting line. “100%” or “100”, is written next to the arrowhead.</p>
    <h3 id="un-44-unify-adjustment-analyses">UN 4.4 Unify adjustment analyses</h3>
    <p><em>Adjustment analyses</em> can offer insight into root causes as they adjust values by neutralizing special
        effects. In general, <em>adjustment analyses</em> are used in conjunction with scenario analyses. Here the
        values
        of one scenario are recalculated with correction factors from another scenario: e.g., adjust AC sales for
        currency effects by re-measuring them with the PY exchange rates.</p>
    <p>Typical <em>adjustment analyses</em> deal with currency, inflation, and seasonal effects.</p>
    <h3 id="un-5-unify-indicators">UN 5 Unify indicators</h3>
    <p><em>Indicators</em> in reports and presentations serve different purposes, e.g. highlighting and scaling. Using

        <li>
            <p><strong>Benchmarks</strong>: Popular benchmarks are market averages, competitors, or best practices.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Position the arrowhead close to the point representing the index or the benchmark. Write the label for the index
        (e.g. “100%” or “100”) or for the benchmark (e.g.“Market avg.”) next to the arrowhead. The arrowhead points in
        the direction of an imaginary index or benchmark line. If helpful, add an assisting line.</p>
    <p><strong>Comment references</strong></p>

        <figcaption>Figure UN 5.1-6: Comment reference</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Use <em>comment references</em> in pairs to link comments to the corresponding values or positions in a chart or
        a
        table.</p>
    <p><strong>Variance highlighting indicators</strong></p>
    <p>Highlight variances in tables by using visualization elements representing the magnitude of the variance, such as
        bars and pins (see also EX 2.5 “<a href="#ex-2%E2%80%945-replace%E2%80%94traffic-lights">Replace traffic
            lights</a>”). “Traffic lights” might be useful for highlighting <em>single variances</em> related to the
        message or to comments in tables without chart elements, though. Another means for highlighting <em>single
            variances</em> are “warning dots” positioned next to the value or text element needing attention.</p>
    <p>Indicators highlighting variances representing a <em>positive impact</em> on business issues are colored light
        green, those representing a <em>negative impact</em> light red. If no color is available, replace red with dark
        gray, green with light gray. For readers with color deficiency, replace green with blue-green.</p>
    <p>Use only few variance highlighting indicators per page.</p>
    <p><strong>Other highlighting</strong></p>
    <p>Add visualization elements for not-valid values, limits, or other relevant phenomena. Standardize and document
        these “signals” so that they become an effective means of communication.</p>
    <h3 id="un-52-unify-scaling-indicators">UN 5.2 Unify scaling indicators</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/un-5.2.png" alt="Figure UN 5.2: Unify scaling indicators">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 5.2: Unify scaling indicators</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Proper <em>scaling</em> is very important for the creation of meaningful charts. Several semantic <em>scaling
            indicators</em> exist to deal with in challenging scaling problems. Use <em>scaling lines</em> and
        <em>scaling
            areas</em> (<em>scaling bars</em>) if necessary, see Figure UN 5.2.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Scaling lines</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-5.2-1.png" alt="Figure UN 5.2-1: Scaling line">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 5.2-1: Scaling line</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Use scaling lines when comparing multiple charts (with the same unit) having different scales. Position a scaling
        line parallel to the category axis at the same numerical height in all charts. If one chart among several other
        charts uses a different scale, this fact can easily be identified (in general, the differing scale uses a
        multiplier of ten).</p>
    <p><strong>Scaling areas</strong></p>
    <figure><img src="img/un-5.2-2.png" alt="Figure UN 5.2-2: Scaling area">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 5.2-2: Scaling area</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If helpful, fill the areas between the scaling lines and the category axes with light color. Use different colors
        for scaling lines and scaling areas used in order to represent different scales.</p>
    <h3 id="un-53-unify-outlier-indicators">UN 5.3 Unify outlier indicators</h3>
    <figure><img src="img/un-5.3.png" alt="Figure UN 5.3: Unify outlier indicators">
        <figcaption>Figure UN 5.3: Unify outlier indicators</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Sometimes values (mostly relative variances) can be very big in comparison to other values. If such
        an <em>outlier</em> is not important for business, e.g. a big relative variance of a small value, do not scale
        the whole chart to this outlier rather visualize unimportant outliers with <em>outlier indicators</em>.</p>
    <p>Omit the pin head and add <em>outlier triangles</em> pointing in the direction of growth, see Figure UN 5.3.</p>
