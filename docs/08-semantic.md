# SEMANTIC RULES

_Semantic rules_ help to clearly relay content by using a uniform notation. They
comprise the third part of this guide with the rule set [UNIFY](09-unify.md).

The semantic rules are based on the work of Rolf
[Hichert](https://www.ibcs.com/consultant/rolf-hichert/) and other contributors
of the [IBCS Association](https://www.ibcs.com/ibcs-association/). As they are
manifested by convention, semantic rules must first be more widely accepted to
become a standard.
