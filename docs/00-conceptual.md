# CONCEPTUAL RULES

_Conceptual rules_ help to clearly relay content by using an appropriate
storyline. They comprise the first part of this guide with the rule sets
[SAY](01-say.md) and [STRUCTURE](02-structure.md).

The conceptual rules are based on the work of authors such as Barbara
[Minto](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516).
Their wide acceptance stems from their scientific, experimental, and practical
experience basis.
